# Proof — the general external-call rung (rung 2): `behaves_call`

The concrete `messageCall_call_storageAt` is about *one* caller (`callerProg`)
calling *one* callee (`calleeProg`) in *one* world. Rung 2 makes the external
call **general over both programs**: for ANY callee characterized by its own
`Behaves` (under a callee precondition `calleePre`, e.g. "the forwarded gas
clears the SSTORE cost"), a caller that forwards a `CALL` to it gets the same
`completedWith a k v` named outcome — with the **63/64 `callGasCap` as the `∃G₀`
gas floor** that makes `calleePre` hold for the child.

## What is genuinely general here, and what the witness supplies

The driver `drive` is a single fuel-bounded recursion over a *flat* pending
stack, so there is no clean "this sub-tree is exactly a child `messageCall`"
decomposition to lean on generically — the parent and child interleave under one
fuel counter. So rung 2 takes a **per-entry
structural witness** about the caller (`CallerForwards`), and the theorem's own
content is the part that is genuinely program-agnostic:

* it **consumes the callee's `Behaves`** generically — the callee is a black box,
  named only by its code and its `calleePre`/`completedWith` contract;
* it threads the **gas floor `G₀`** so that `G₀ ≤ p.gas` forces `calleePre` on the
  child params the caller produces (this is where the 63/64 cap lives);
* it lands everything on the named `Outcome`, never a raw `.ok`.

The witness packages exactly the *caller-specific* facts the engine cannot know
generically: which child params `cp` the caller's `CALL` produces, that they run
`calleeCode` and satisfy `calleePre`, and that the caller **faithfully forwards**
a completed child's outcome to the top level
(`Outcome.ofCall (messageCall p) = Outcome.ofCall (messageCall cp)`). The
concrete `callerProg` instance discharges that witness from the existing
reflexive child-run reductions in `ExternalCall.lean`.

## The world must be constrained — `callerPre` is a genuine parameter

A subtlety the design's draft signature glossed: `Behaves` quantifies over **all**
worlds `p` running `callerCode`, but a caller only forwards to *this* callee when
the world actually places `calleeCode` at the called address. In an adversarial
world (different code at the target, or no account there) the call fails and the
cell is untouched — so a conclusion of the bare form `Behaves (fun p => G₀ ≤
p.gas) callerCode …` is simply **false** over all worlds (the `CallerForwards.hcode`
field cannot be supplied there). The honest, sound statement therefore keeps a
**caller precondition** `callerPre : World → Prop` (conjoined with the gas floor)
that pins the world enough for forwarding to hold; every other design decision is
unchanged — callee as its own `Behaves`, named `Outcome`, the `∃G₀` 63/64 floor,
gas first-class. The concrete instance supplies `callerPre p := ∃ g, p =
callerParams g`, recovering the original fixed-world `∃G₀ ∀g` theorem. -/

/-! ## The per-entry caller-forwarding witness -/

/-- `CallerForwards callerCode calleeCode calleePre G₀ p`: the caller-specific
facts rung 2 needs for entry `p` (running `callerCode` with `G₀ ≤ p.gas`). It
names the child `CallParams cp` the caller's `CALL` descends into and asserts:

* **`hcode`** — `cp` runs the callee's real code (`calleeCode`), so the callee's
  own `Behaves` applies to it (no oracle: the child is a genuine `messageCall`);
* **`hpre`** — `cp` satisfies the callee precondition `calleePre`. This is the
  load-bearing gas fact: with `G₀ ≤ p.gas`, the 63/64 `callGasCap` forwards enough
  gas that `calleePre cp` holds (in the instance, `calleePre cp = 22106 ≤ cp.gas`
  via `childGas_lb`);
* **`hforward`** — IF the child completes leaving `v` at `(a, k)`, the **top-level**
  call also completes leaving `v` at `(a, k)`
  (`completedWith (ofCall (messageCall p)) a k v`). This is the faithful-forwarding
  fact the concrete reflexive child run establishes: in a completing run the caller
  carries the child's committed cell straight to the top-level observable and does
  no further write to `(a, k)`. Note this asks only that the *cell* survive, not
  that the whole `Outcome` (output bytes, full storage map) match — the caller may
  legitimately return different bytes or touch other cells.

The theorem feeds `cp` to the callee's `Behaves` to get `completedWith`, then
forwards it to the top level through `hforward`. -/

/-! ## The general rung-2 theorem -/

/-- **Rung 2: the general external-call theorem (`behaves_call`).** For ANY callee
characterized by its own `Behaves calleePre calleeCode (completedWith … a k v)`, a
caller (`callerCode`) that forwards a `CALL` to it `Behaves` with the **same**
`completedWith a k v` named outcome, for every entry satisfying `callerPre` whose
gas clears a floor `G₀` — the floor being exactly the `∃G₀` the 63/64 `callGasCap`
forces.

The callee is consumed only through its `Behaves` (a black box). The caller is
supplied a per-entry `CallerForwards` witness; the theorem applies the callee's
`Behaves` to the witness's child params and rewrites the top-level outcome through
the forwarding equation. Gas stays first-class: `G₀ ≤ p.gas` is part of the `pre`,
and `CallerForwards` ties it to `calleePre cp` on the child. `callerPre` carries
whatever world constraint forwarding needs (see the module note); for the bare
"any world" reading take `callerPre := fun _ => True`. -/

/-! ## Re-deriving the concrete external call as an instance

`messageCall_call_storageAt` (the original fixed-world `∃G₀ ∀g` theorem about
`callerProg` calling `calleeProg`) is now an **instance** of `behaves_call`: the
callee `calleeProg` is characterized by its own `Behaves`, and the caller supplies
a `CallerForwards` witness from the reflexive child run.
