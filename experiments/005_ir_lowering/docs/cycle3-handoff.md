# exp005 cycle-3 handoff (2026-06-29)

Branch: `ir-convergence`. Baseline at cycle-3 start: `bec9f76` (green + axiom-clean).
HEAD after cycle-3: `62a9c53`. Build re-verified: **`lake build` → "Build completed
successfully (1158 jobs)"**. No `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide` in touched files (sole grep
hit is a docstring at TieDischarge.lean:70). All new lemmas `#print axioms` →
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (guards appended in-file, re-verified in build log).

Two tasks landed this cycle: **RUNSFACTOR** (gas) and **HMONO** (CALL seam). Both are pure
ADDITIONS — zero existing signature/structure changes, paramsRemoved = [] on both.

---

## (a) What LANDED

### RUNSFACTOR — commit `1ec1304`
File: `experiments/003_bytecode_layer/BytecodeLayer/Hoare.lean` (+41 lines, pure addition,
right after `Runs.step_to_halt`).
- **`Runs.step_cancel`** `{fr mid fr'} (hrun : Runs fr fr') (hstep : StepsTo fr mid) :
  Runs mid fr' ∨ fr = fr'` — single deterministic-step FRONT cancellation. Mirror of the
  green `step_to_halt`: `cases hrun` three-arm inversion (`.refl → Or.inr rfl`;
  `.step → StepsTo.det` then `Or.inl rest`; `.call → vacuous` via `.next ≠ .needsCall`).
  This is **fully PROVEN** (no supplied hyps).
- **`Runs.gas_cancel`** `(hrun) (hdec) (hsz) (hgas) (hne : fr ≠ fr') : Runs (gasFrame fr) fr'`
  — gas-specialized wrapper: feeds `StepsTo fr (gasFrame fr)` via
  `stepsTo_of_next (stepFrame_gas …)` and resolves the disjunct with `hne`. **PROVEN modulo
  the single supplied residual `hne`** (load-bearing, satisfiable — see (b)).

### HMONO — commit `62a9c53`
File: `experiments/005_ir_lowering/LirLean/TieDischarge.lean` (+1217 lines, pure addition,
engine bricks ~1803–2996, wrapper ~3567–3583).
- **`Evm.stepFrame_next_accMono`** (Brick C / `hmono`) — THE deliverable: fully-general
  arbitrary-address `a` re-derivation of the proven SELF-address dispatch family. PROVEN,
  every `.next` opcode case closed (exhaustive `cases` over dispatch/systemOp/smsfOp).
  Supporting bricks all PROVEN: `dispatch_next_accMono`, `systemOp_next_accMono`,
  `smsfOp_next_accMono` (all 15 SmsfOp), `callArm_next_accMono`, `createArm_next_accMono`,
  `pushOp/unOp/binOp/ternOp/dup/swap/logArm/unStateOp_next_accMono`,
  `charge_sstore/charge_tstore_next_accMono`, `sstore_accMono`, `tstore_accMono`,
  `dispatch_simple_arm_next_accMono`, `accMono_replaceOfBase`, `replaceStackAndIncrPC_accounts`.
- **`Evm.stepFrame_needsCall_inv`** — PROVEN (`hcall_acc` + `hcall_kind` + `hcall_self`),
  via stepFrame→systemOp→callArm needsCall inversion.
- **`Evm.stepFrame_halted_success_accMono`** (`hhalt`) — PROVEN: STOP/RETURN verbatim,
  SELFDESTRUCT honestly case-split as verbatim / ≤2 inserts (no `RBMap.erase`).
- **`Lir.callPreservesSelf_modGuards`** — PAYOFF wrapper instantiating the 5 proven facts.

---

## (b) Vacuity / circularity findings (reviewer-accepted both tasks)

- `Runs.step_cancel`: NOT vacuous — both disjuncts reachable (2+-step run → `Or.inl`;
  `Runs.refl` → `Or.inr`). NOT circular — consumes only the generic `Runs` inductive +
  `StepsTo.det`, zero gas/Corr reference; the `.step` arm's `Runs mid fr'` is the run's OWN
  tail `rest`, not a re-handed Runs.
- `Runs.gas_cancel.hne` (`fr ≠ fr'`): load-bearing, NOT vacuous — at `fr = fr'` the conclusion
  is generally false, so `hne` is correct not a dodge; satisfiable because GAS advances pc.
- `stepFrame_next_accMono`: NOT vacuous — exhaustive opcode coverage, green build rules out a
  missing/too-narrow case. SELFDESTRUCT genuinely case-split (no erase). NOT circular —
  engine lemmas reference `CallPreservesSelf` only in docstrings; discharge flows one way
  (proven engine facts → `callPreservesSelf_modGuards`).
- No overclaim: `paramsRemoved = []` confirmed by pure-addition diffs; `callPreservesSelf`
  itself KEEPS all 7 hyps; commit messages explicitly disclaim "hypothesis-free".

---

## (c) CALL seam — PRECISE status of the 7 `callPreservesSelf` hyps

PROVEN engine-level this cycle (5 of 7):
1. `hmono` — `stepFrame_next_accMono`. **PROVEN.**
2. `hcall_acc` — from `stepFrame_needsCall_inv`. **PROVEN.**
3. `hcall_kind` — from `stepFrame_needsCall_inv`. **PROVEN.**
4. `hcall_self` — from `stepFrame_needsCall_inv`. **PROVEN.**
5. `hhalt` — `stepFrame_halted_success_accMono`. **PROVEN.**

Still SUPPLIED (2 of 7) — genuinely conditional, NOT discharged:
6. `hprec` (beginCall `.inr` precompile-output presence) — opaque precompile output map in the
   `accounts'' ≠ ∅` branch; satisfiable (the `==∅` and out-of-1..10 fallbacks return
   `params.accounts`; vacuous for call-free lowered IR) but NOT structurally provable for an
   arbitrary precompile target. Kept supplied honestly.
7. `hncr` (EngineReaches-scoped no-CREATE seam) — drive's CREATE-fault arm sets
   `accounts := ∅` (a REAL erase). Correctly scoped to the child run's reachable frames (NOT
   the false universal ∀fr). Discharge via a decidable `WellFormedLowered.NotCreate` guard is
   a designated follow-on.

**`callPreservesSelf` itself is UNCHANGED — it still carries all 7 supplied hyps.** The
reduction "7 → 2 supplied" is realized ONLY in the NEW `callPreservesSelf_modGuards` wrapper,
which feeds the 5 proven facts and leaves `hprec` + `hncr` supplied.

**Downstream `hcall : CallPreservesSelf` param: NOT removed anywhere.** This is by design and
sound: `callPreservesSelf` does NOT become hypothesis-free (the precompile/CREATE ∅-arms
really can erase), so the bundled `CallPreservesSelf` abstraction stays at `selfPresent_runs`
/ L2.0 / halt+edge wrappers — they consume the bundle and need no change. The honest status is
**CALL seam REDUCED-modulo-2-supplied, not closed.**

---

## (d) GAS — Runs left-cancellation and the walk

- **Runs left-cancellation: LANDED** as `Runs.step_cancel` (PROVEN) + `Runs.gas_cancel`
  (PROVEN modulo satisfiable `hne`). This is the missing brick that cycle-2 flagged as the
  blocker (RUNSFACTOR).
- **Gas-advancing walk: STILL BLOCKED-as-deferred, NOT yet landed.** The full per-cursor
  induction `driveCorrPlus_run_stmts_gasadvance` was intentionally NOT implemented this cycle.
  RUNSFACTOR delivered the CAPABILITY to factor `Runs fr0 fr0'` into `Runs (gasFrame fr0) fr0'`
  (continuation past a `.gas` cursor), so the walk is now UNBLOCKED on the left-cancellation
  axis — but it remains a separate larger task that still consumes the unchanged cycle-2 S4
  decode/gas envelope bundle per `.gas` cursor and needs `hne` supplied (derivable later from
  `stepFrame fr0 = .next _ → fr0 ≠ fr0'`, since gasPost advances pc). Honest status:
  **left-cancellation proven; the walk that uses it is the next task, not done.**

---

## (e) Remaining obstacles + roadmap to C9

Standing supplied/conditional residuals (all honest, none vacuous):
- CALL seam: `hprec` (opaque precompile) + `hncr` (no-CREATE erase seam) — fold `hncr` into a
  decidable `WellFormedLowered.NotCreate` guard; `hprec` is vacuous for call-free lowered IR.
- GAS: the S4 decode/gas envelope bundle (S3/S4 runtime envelopes, unchanged) + the
  `gasadvance` walk itself.

Roadmap (plan §C4–C9, `docs/p5-discharge-plan.md` ~271–278):
- C4 halt wrappers (T1/T2), C5 edge wrappers (T3/T4/D2/D3) — landed earlier (`516f166`,
  `bec9f76`) as `driveCorrPlus_step_stop/_ret/_jump/_branch`.
- **NEXT**: implement `driveCorrPlus_run_stmts_gasadvance` (gas walk, now unblocked by
  `Runs.gas_cancel`); then the decidable `NotCreate` guard to discharge `hncr`.
- C6 Tier-3 strengthened recursion (`runFrom_of_driveCorrPlus`).
- C7 P2 (`modellableStep_lower`) ⇒ entry `CleanHalts`.
- C8 Route 4b (`sim_cfg_along_drive`) — thread emitted ties into the world equation.
- C9 P6 (L5.1 → L5.2) — the tie-free headlines (`lower_conforms_cyclic_tiefree`).
