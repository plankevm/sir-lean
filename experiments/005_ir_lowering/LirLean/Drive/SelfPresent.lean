/-! ### The single-`obs` collapse (the `Corr`-model–compatible alignment, DISCHARGED)

The `Corr` invariant the whole `sim_*` block walk threads (`SimStmt.lean`) carries a **single
fixed `obs : Word`** in `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` (`MaterialiseRuns.lean`), universal over every
same-address frame: `∀ g, g.addr = fr.addr → obs = ofUInt64 (g.gasAvailable − Gbase)`. The IR's
`evalExpr st obs .gas = some obs` reads that *same* `obs` for **every** `Expr.gas` (`Spec/Semantics.lean`).
So within the `Corr` model the realised gas value is one word for the whole run — the recorded list
`log.gas` is positionally selected by `aligned_read_eq_obs` only when its aligned witnesses all
report that one word (e.g. a run with a single top-level GAS read).

`gasRealises_obs_of_witness` discharges exactly that: from the single-`obs` tie at a GAS cursor and
an alignment whose witness frame at index `i` is that cursor's post-charge `gasFrame`, the
positionally-selected recorded read `gasAcc[i]` **is** `obs`. This closes the GAS selection
end-to-end *for the `Corr` model the construction actually uses* — the recorded read at the cursor's
position is the cursor's `obs`. (The complementary direction — building the universal `obs`-form tie
from a *multi-entry* aligned list with distinct reads — is impossible in the single-`obs` model and
needs the `Corr` refactor to a per-cursor gas stream; reported as the standing obstacle.) -/

/-- **The single-`obs` selection discharge.** At a GAS cursor frame `fr` carrying the `Corr`-model
gas tie `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` (the universal-over-same-address form), if the alignment's witness
frame at index `i` is `fr`'s post-charge `gasFrame fr` (which shares `fr`'s address, `rfl`), then the
positionally-selected recorded read `gasAcc[i]` **is** `obs` — the cursor's gas observation. The §7
GAS per-cursor selection, discharged end-to-end in the single-`obs` model the block walk threads:
`aligned_read_eq_obs` gives `gasAcc[i] = ofUInt64 (fr.gas − Gbase)`, and the tie at the witness frame
`gasFrame fr` (same address) gives that word `= obs`. -/
