# LirLean v2 — discharging the §7 *value* ties from the recorded run (`TieDischarge`)

The cyclic construction (`V2/DriveSim.lean`) still **supplies** the per-cursor §7 ties
(`SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep` packing `GasRealises`/`SloadRealises`/`MemRealises` + the per-edge
bundles). This module banks the pieces of those ties that are **derivable** from the realised
`runWithLog`/`drive` execution, and lays the **positional-alignment foundation** the remaining
ties (GAS, SLOAD warmth) reduce to.

The three value channels split cleanly by *how much* of them is alignment-free:

* **CALL** (`realisedCall_projection`, §1) — already a clean recorded-CALL projection: when the
  log recorded a CALL, `realisedCall log self` **is** `evmV2CallOracle` at that record
  (`realisedCall_eq_evmV2`, `simp`-clean). The `o = evmV2CallOracle …` conjunct of `CallRealises`
  is therefore *discharged*, not supplied (the rest of `CallRealises` — the `Runs`/`CallReturns`
  resume-frame pins — is the structural call trace the drive walk's CALL-boundary produces, not a
  value tie). **Status: DISCHARGED (value channel).**

* **GAS** (§2) — the *arithmetic* is alignment-free and `rfl`: the recorder appends
  `UInt256.ofUInt64 exec.gasAvailable` at a top-level GAS `.next` step, where `exec` is the
  post-charge exec `gasPost current.exec`; that word is **exactly** `gasReadOf (gasFrame current)`
  (`gasRecord_eq_gasReadOf`), and `gasReadOf (gasFrame fr)` is exactly the word the `obs`-form
  `Lir.GasRealises` (`MaterialiseRuns.lean`) demands at the pre-charge frame `fr`
  (`gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs`). What is **not** alignment-free is *which* recorded read pairs with
  *which* cursor: `realisedGas log = log.gas` is a flat program-order list, and the `obs`-form
  `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` (universal over every same-address frame) needs the alignment to know
  the cursor's `obs` is the matching list entry. That is Part 3 (§3). **Status: arithmetic bridge
  DISCHARGED; per-cursor selection reduced to the alignment.**

* **SLOAD** (`SloadRealises`, `MaterialiseRuns.lean`) — `sloadChg k` is the actual warmth cost at
  the SLOAD cursor. The recorder logs **only** GAS reads and CALLs, not warmth, so `sloadChg`
  cannot be a projection of the *current* `RunLog`: making `SloadRealises` definitional needs the
  recorder to log the per-SLOAD warmth flag (a new `RunLog` field + a recording splice in
  `driveLog` + the matching adequacy clause in `driveLog_drive`). Scoped, **not** done in this pass
  (the invasive interpreter change is out of scope per the brief). **Status: SCOPED (cost below).**

## Part 3 — the positional-alignment foundation (§3)

The ties are per-cursor `(L, pc)`; the recorder logs a flat program-order list (`log.gas`). The
drive walk (`drive_step_block_*`, threading `DriveCorr` cursor-by-cursor) visits exactly those
cursors in order, and the recorder's top-level gate (`isGasOp current && stack.isEmpty`) means the
recorded reads are the **top-level** program's GAS reads in that same order.

The alignment substrate already exists frame-side: `Oracle.GasRealises T frs` (`V2/Oracle.lean`)
is the **list-level** realisability — `T = frs.map gasReadOf` (positional read-equality) together
with `FramesRun frs` (the GAS-frames `Runs`-threaded in program order). What is missing is the
bridge to the **recorder**: that `log.gas` (the `driveLog` accumulator) **is** `frs.map gasReadOf`
for the GAS-frames `frs` the drive walk visits. §3 defines that coupling (`GasLogAligned`) and
proves the **foundational per-op step**: a top-level GAS `.next` step grows the accumulator by
exactly `gasReadOf (gasFrame current)` and the witness list by `gasFrame current`, preserving
alignment (`gasLogAligned_step_gas`); a non-recording step leaves the accumulator fixed
(`gasLogAligned_step_norecord`). The remaining obstacle (reported below) is the full
walk-induction threading `GasLogAligned` through the `driveLog`/`drive` recursion alongside the
`DriveCorr` cursor — and then projecting the *list*-level `Oracle.GasRealises` back to the
*per-cursor* `obs`-form `Lir.GasRealises` at each GAS cursor.

No `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`; axioms `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-! ## §1 — CALL: the recorded-CALL projection is `evmV2CallOracle` (DISCHARGED)

`realisedCall log self` is, when the log recorded a CALL, exactly `evmV2CallOracle` at that record
(`realisedCall_eq_evmV2`). So `CallRealises`'s realised-oracle conjunct `o = evmV2CallOracle …` is
produced from the recording, not supplied. We re-expose it as the named value-channel discharge. -/

/-- **CALL value-channel discharge.** With the run's recorded CALLs led by `rec`, the realised
oracle is `evmV2CallOracle rec.result rec.pending self` — the `resumeAfterCall` projection. This is
the `o = evmV2CallOracle …` conjunct of `CallRealises`, *discharged* from the recording
(`realisedCall_eq_evmV2`, `simp`-clean), not supplied. -/

/-! ## §2 — GAS: the arithmetic bridge (alignment-free, DISCHARGED)

The recorded read at a top-level GAS `.next` step and the word the per-cursor `obs`-form
`Lir.GasRealises` demands are the **same** `UInt256.ofUInt64 (gasAvailable − Gbase)`, with no
appeal to alignment — pure `gasPost`/`gasFrame` arithmetic. -/

/-- The recorded GAS word at a `current` whose GAS step is `stepFrame current = .next exec` is
exactly `gasReadOf (gasFrame current)`: the recorder appends `UInt256.ofUInt64 exec.gasAvailable`,
and for a GAS op `exec = gasPost current.exec`, so `{ current with exec := exec } = gasFrame
current` and the appended word is its `gasReadOf`. -/

    (hstep : stepFrame current = .next exec) :

/-- The word `gasReadOf (gasFrame fr)` is exactly the value the per-cursor `obs`-form
`Lir.GasRealises obs fr` demands at the **pre-charge** frame `fr`: both are
`UInt256.ofUInt64 (fr.exec.gasAvailable − UInt64.ofNat Gbase)`. So once the alignment supplies that
the GAS cursor's `obs` is this recorded read, `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` at the cursor frame is
`rfl`-discharged (the universal-over-`g` form additionally needs the alignment's
all-same-address-frames-agree fact — the §3 obstacle). -/

/-! ## §3 — the positional-alignment foundation (Part 3, STARTED)

The coupling between the recorder's gas accumulator and the GAS-frames the drive walk visits, and
the foundational per-op step that advances both in lockstep. We reuse `Oracle.GasRealises`'s
witness shape (`T = frs.map gasReadOf ∧ FramesRun frs`) directly. -/

/-- **The gas-log alignment invariant.** A `driveLog` accumulator `gasAcc` is *aligned* with a
witness list of GAS-frames `frs` (the post-charge frames at each recorded GAS site, in program
order, `Runs`-threaded) when it is exactly their reported words. This is `Oracle.GasRealises` read
as an invariant on the recorder's accumulator: `gasAcc = frs.map gasReadOf` (positional
read-equality) together with `FramesRun frs` (the frames `Runs`-threaded). The drive walk threads
this alongside the `DriveCorr` cursor; §3's foundational steps show one op preserves it. -/
def GasLogAligned (gasAcc : List Word) (frs : List Frame) : Prop :=
  gasAcc = frs.map gasReadOf ∧ FramesRun frs

/-- The empty accumulator is aligned with the empty witness list — the drive walk's seed. -/
theorem gasLogAligned_nil : GasLogAligned [] [] := ⟨rfl, trivial⟩

/-- **`FramesRun` extends on the right by a `Runs`-reachable frame.** Appending a frame `g`
reachable (`Runs last g`) from the current last frame `last` of a non-empty `Runs`-threaded list
keeps it `Runs`-threaded. The structural step the GAS-record arm uses to grow the witness list. -/

/-- **Foundational per-op step — the GAS-record arm.** At a top-level GAS `.next` step
(`stepFrame current = .next exec`, `current.stack = []` so the recorder's `isGasOp && stack.isEmpty`
gate fires), the recorder appends one word and the witness list one frame, in lockstep:
the new accumulator `gasAcc ++ [UInt256.ofUInt64 exec.gasAvailable]` is aligned with
`frs ++ [gasFrame current]`, provided the current witness list ends at a frame from which
`current` (hence `gasFrame current`) is reachable (`Runs`-threaded). The appended word is exactly
`gasReadOf (gasFrame current)` (`gasRecord_eq_gasReadOf`), so read-equality extends; `FramesRun`
extends by `FramesRun.snoc`. -/

GAS read leaves the gas accumulator (and the witness list) unchanged, so alignment is preserved
verbatim. This is the common case the walk-induction threads between GAS cursors (every non-GAS op,
and GAS reads inside a descended CALL where `stack ≠ []`). -/

/-! ### Projecting list-level alignment back to a per-cursor `obs` tie

`Oracle.GasRealises (frs.map gasReadOf) frs` (which `GasLogAligned gasAcc frs` packages, with
`gasAcc = frs.map gasReadOf`) is the *list*-level realisability. The §7 per-cursor tie is the
`obs`-form `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` at each GAS cursor `fr`. The bridge for a single read is
`gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs`: at the GAS cursor frame, the matching list entry `gasReadOf (gasFrame
fr)` is the `obs` value the cursor tie demands. The reduction to alignment is then exactly: pick
the witness frame `frs[i]` for the `i`-th GAS cursor (the alignment's positional pairing) and read
off its `gasReadOf` as that cursor's `obs`. -/

/-- **The list→cursor read bridge.** The `i`-th entry of an aligned accumulator is the `obs` value
the §7 tie demands at the `i`-th GAS cursor frame `gasFrame fr` — i.e. `GasLogAligned`'s positional
read at a GAS site is exactly `Lir.GasRealises`'s required word there. The per-cursor tie is thus
the alignment's positional read, modulo the walk-induction that pairs cursor `i` with witness frame
`i` (the §3 obstacle). -/
