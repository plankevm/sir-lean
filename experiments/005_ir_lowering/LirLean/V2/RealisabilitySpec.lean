# LirLean v2 — the REALISABILITY SPEC skeleton (Phase-3 target statements; Nightly-only)

**EVERY `sorry` IN THIS FILE IS TRACKED DEBT.** This module is the reviewable Phase-3
specification: the flagship `lowering_conforms` (R11) is the target statement of the whole
experiment, and the obligations R1–R12 are the named gaps between the green machinery in the
tree and that flagship. All `def`s/`structure`s here are REAL (complete, no `sorry`); only
theorem PROOFS are `sorry`d. This module is deliberately registered in the NON-DEFAULT
`Nightly` lean_lib — the default `LirLean` target stays sorry-free and does not import it.

## The vacuity lessons this file is shaped by

1. **The retired `Lir.GasRealises` universal** (HonestGasTie's finding, Phase 2): a single
   fixed gas word, universally quantified over frames pinned only by address, is
   unsatisfiable — one adversarial frame with a different `gasAvailable` refutes it.
2. **The free-`∀` disease in the former `StmtTies`/`TermTies`**
   (`docs/fleet-2026-07-02/skeptic-f1-verdict.md`): a variable universally quantified in the
   tie, pinned to a run-specific value in the conclusion, with no antecedent linking it to
   the run (`ob` in the gas conjunct, `w` in the sload conjunct, `st0'` in the assign
   conjunct, the address/kind/gas demands of `TermTies`). The supplied tie hypotheses of
   `lower_conforms_cyclic_assembled` are FALSE for essentially every nonempty program.
3. **NEW (this file's audit): `Lir.SstoreRealises` is itself free-`∀` unsatisfiable**
   (`LirLean/SimStmt.lean:318`): it quantifies over EVERY frame `g` pinned only by
   address + stack shape and concludes gas facts about `g` — an adversarial zero-gas frame
   with the same address/stack refutes it, so `∃ acc, SstoreRealises fr kw vw acc` (the
   `StmtTies` sstore conjunct) is false for every `fr`. The reshape here DROPS that conjunct;
   its content returns point-wise at the concrete frame (R4).
4. **NEW (this file's audit): `Lir.V2.RunDefinable` is unsatisfiable for every program
   containing a `Stmt.call` or a gas read** (`LirLean/V2/IRRun.lean`): its `stmts` field
   demands `StmtsDefinable st b.stmts` for every present block, and `StmtDefinable`'s
   `.call` arm is literally `False` while its assign arm demands `e ≠ .gas`. Folding
   `RunDefinable` into the flagship's static bundle would make the flagship VACUOUS on
   exactly the gas-reading/calling domain it exists for. `WellLowered.defs` below therefore
   uses the gas/call-aware `RunDefinableG` (this file), whose definability is threaded along
   `RunStmts` itself (the semantics natively handles the gas-stream/oracle supply).
5. Two further refutable-∃ shapes found while re-running the skeptic drill on the PLANNED
   reshape, fixed before statement: the sload arm's planned `∃ w, evalExpr st0 0 (.sload k)
   = some w` conclusion (an empty-locals `Corr` witness refutes it — the key binding must be
   an ANTECEDENT, mirroring the sstore arm), and the ret arm's `∃ vw, st'.locals t = some vw`
   conclusion (same refutation — the epilogue block is stated under a `∀ vw`-antecedent
   instead, as the original's inner block already was).
6. **NEW (independent review drill): the `defsOf`-consistency hole.** `defsOf`
   (`Lowering.lean`) is a FIRST-find over program order while `emitStmt` keys its spill
   stash on `defsOf t`, so a program that redefines a tmp with mixed pure/spill defs
   (e.g. `[.assign t (.imm 1), .assign t .gas]`) emits NO GAS byte at the shadowed def yet
   `EvalStmt.assignGas` demands a gas-stream head — refuting the flagship INSIDE its
   hypothesis envelope (`RunDefinableG`'s gas arm is unconditionally true). The per-cursor
   fact was already consumed by the walk (`defsSound_preserved_assignPure`'s `hself`,
   `DefsSound.lean`) but lived only in per-lemma side conditions — a free-∀-ADJACENT
   disease instance: a scope assumption absent from the statement's hypothesis surface.
   Fixed statically: `WellLowered.defsCons` (`DefsConsistent`, decidable, R9-checkable).
7. **NEW (independent review drill): `SingleCall` is syntactic but the realised oracle is
   dynamic.** `callOracleOf` replays only the HEAD `CallRecord`, so a syntactically-single
   call inside a loop that fires per iteration with differing child outcomes refutes
   R3/`Conforms` at the second iteration — the loop caveat previously recorded only as a
   docstring note, i.e. not a hypothesis. Fixed with the decidable LOG-side premise
   `hone : log.calls.length ≤ 1` on R3/R10a and all three flagships — exactly the domain
   on which the head-projection oracle is correct.
8. **NEW (round-3 review): the inherited SCOPING conjuncts carried the same refutable-∀
   disease as the value conjuncts.** `Lir.StepScoped`'s live-scope clause
   (`DefsSound.lean:514`) demands, at an `assign t _` cursor, that NO currently-bound
   tmp's registered def reads `t` — a free-∀ over the live set, refuted BY THE FILE'S OWN
   WITNESS at `exProg`'s second loop-iteration entry (block 1, pc 0: `t6 := gas` rebinds
   `t6` while `t8` is bound from iteration 1 with `defsOf exProg t8 = some (.lt t6 t7)`),
   a real on-run state fully consistent with `Corr`/`RecorderCoupled`/
   `CleanHaltsNonException`. Mechanism: the clause is define-before-use, and a LOOP
   re-binds tmps with live dependents by construction. The root cause is deeper than the
   ties: on the loop-EXIT iteration, between the `t6` rebind and `t8`'s reassign,
   recompute-on-use `DefsSound` is ITSELF false at the real mid-block states (`t8` holds
   the stale `0` while `evalExpr (.lt t6 t7) = 1` — machine-checked at
   `not_defsSound_stale`). The LOWERING is not misbehaving — rematerialisation is
   exercised only at USE sites, and a bound-but-unused stale dependent is harmless to the
   lowered code; the INVARIANT was overclaiming. Fix (route (i), shadowing-aware): the
   ties' scoping conclusions are the STATIC residue `StepScopedS` (and `CallRealisesS`
   for the call arm); staleness is tracked by an explicit invalidation set
   (`ReadsOf`/`invalStep`/`DefsSoundS`); and the forced machinery reshape is the NEW
   tracked obligation R0b — the current sim machinery (`Corr.defsSound` at every
   statement cursor) cannot traverse a loop-exit iteration of a rebinding program. The
   witness `exProg` STAYS AS IS: it exercises rebinding-with-live-dependents by
   construction, which is exactly why it caught this.

## The two scope seams added beyond the fleet sketch

* **`RunLog.clean` conservatively excludes zero-gas reverts**: exp003's `endCall` maps an
  `.exception` to `success := false, gasRemaining := 0, output := .empty`, so a genuine
  zero-gas revert is indistinguishable from an exception ON THE LOG. `clean` demands
  `success ∨ gasRemaining ≠ 0` — sound (hypothesis false ⇒ theorem silent, never unsound),
  and it cuts the zero-gas-revert corner out of scope. Tracked decision.
* **`NonzeroSstores`**: `sim_sstore_stmt` requires `vw ≠ 0` (the nonzero-write scope of
  `EvalStmt.sstore`, `V2/Machine.lean`), and no fleet report surfaced this in the flagship
  signature. It is a named scope seam (the flagship's `hnzw`), threaded through the walk
  invariant (`DriveCorrLog.nonzeroSstores`) — either `sim_sstore` gets extended to zero
  writes or SSTOREs get recorded in the log; until then the seam is honest and explicit.

Every declaration's docstring states what is SUPPLIED (hypothesis surface of the flagship /
honest seam) vs DERIVED (an R-obligation discharges it from the run or the program text).

/-! ## §1 — Helper definitions (all REAL; no sorry)

The flagship's hypothesis vocabulary: the entry state, the log-side clean-scope predicate,
observable agreement, the static well-formedness bundle, the honest oracle seams, and the
scope seams. -/

/-- The IR entry state of a top-level call: empty locals, world = the recipient's storage
lens of the pre-call accounts (the `find?/lookupStorage` lens `resultStorageAt`/`observe`
read, applied to `params.accounts`). Replaces the supplied entry `StorageAgree` hypothesis
of the since-deleted `lower_conforms_wf` BY DEFINITION — the entry world *is* the params' lens (the pin is
then `rfl`-flavoured at the entry `codeFrame`, whose `accounts` are `params.accounts`).
DERIVED status: definitional (nothing to discharge). -/
def entryState (params : CallParams) : IRState :=
  { locals := fun _ => none
    world  := fun k => (params.accounts.find? params.recipient).option 0 (·.lookupStorage k) }

/-- **The log-side clean-scope predicate** (the flagship's `hclean`). The recorded run
halted cleanly: a top-level `.call` result that either succeeded or reverted with gas left.

Ground truth (`endCall`, exp003 `Evm/Semantics/Call.lean`): `.success → success := true`;
`.revert g o → success := false, gasRemaining := g`; `.exception → success := false,
gasRemaining := 0, output := .empty`. So an exception is distinguishable from a revert ON
THE LOG only via `gasRemaining ≠ 0` — **a genuine zero-gas revert is conservatively
excluded** (scope cut; sound: the hypothesis is then false and the flagship silent). The
fleet sketch's `ResultNonException` does not exist in the tree; this is its honest
decidable-on-the-log replacement. A `.create` observable is out of scope (top-level frames
here are calls). SUPPLIED status: a decidable premise read off the log (both branches are
`Bool`/`DecidableEq` facts). R2 turns it into the `∀ last halt`-universal
`cleanHalts_of_runWithLog` consumes. -/
def RunLog.clean (log : RunLog) : Prop :=
  match log.observable with
    | .call r   => r.success = true ∨ r.gasRemaining ≠ 0
    | .create _ => False

/-- **Observable agreement, world channel** (the flagship's conclusion edge). The IR
observable's world equals the `observe`-world of the recorded bytecode result. The
halt-result channel is the documented empty-RETURN cut (`observe` maps every result to
`.stopped`; the value channel is deferred with the rest of the RETURN-output work —
`V2/RunLog.lean`, `observe` docstring). DERIVED status: the conclusion, not a premise. -/
def Conforms (self : AccountAddress) (log : RunLog) (O : Observable) : Prop :=
  O.world = (observe self log.observable).world

/-- **Static CFG closure** — entry present and pc-bounded, every jump/branch target present,
in-bounds, and offset-bounded. Folds the current headline's `hentry0`-adjacent presence
facts, `hjumpPresent`, `hbranchPresent`, and the `offsetTable … < 2^32` bounds that
`entry_corr` and the edge bundles consume. SUPPLIED status: static, a finite check on the
program text (the R9 checker's territory); R8 is its named consumer (kills the inside-out
`hpresent`). -/

      ∧ offsetTable (defsOf prog) (recomputeFuel prog) prog.blocks elseL.idx < 2 ^ 32)

/-- **Static stack-room bounds** — the per-cursor `chargeOf`-length ≤ 1024 folds the ties
carry (`hstkBranch` of the assembled headline; the `hstkKey` bound of the sload arm; the
sstore fold; the ret fold). Quantified `∀ sloadChg` and PROVABLE that way: `chargeOf`'s
LENGTH is structurally independent of the `sloadChg` values (each `.sload` contributes
exactly one entry whatever the charge). SUPPLIED status: static, decidable per program
(R9's checker discharges it). -/

  /-- The spilled-sload key-prefix stack fold (the tie's `hstkKey`; the frame term is 0 at
  a statement boundary by `Corr.stack_nil`, so the pure charge-length bound suffices). -/
  sloadKey : ∀ (sloadChg : Tmp → ℕ) (L : Label) (b : Block) (pc : Nat) (t k : Tmp),
    blockAt prog L = some b → b.stmts[pc]? = some (.assign t (.sload k)) →

/-! ### Gas/call-aware run-definability (`RunDefinableG`)

The existing `RunDefinable` (`V2/IRRun.lean`) is UNSATISFIABLE for any program with a
`Stmt.call` or a gas read (header lesson 4), so it cannot be the flagship's definability
bundle. The honest replacement threads definability along `RunStmts` itself: the semantics
natively supplies the gas word (stream head) and the call bundle (oracle query), so "the
operands of the statement at cursor `pc` are bound at every state `RunStmts` reaches by
running the prefix" is exactly the fact `RunFrom`-existence needs — and it is state-uniform
in the block-ENTRY state (the same sound over-approximation the old bundle used), while the
INTERMEDIATE states are pinned by the derivation, never free. -/

/-- Gas/call-aware operand definability of one statement at state `st`: what the matching
`EvalStmt` constructor demands of `st` (the gas word / call bundle are supplied by the
stream / oracle, so a gas assign is unconditionally definable). -/
def StmtDefinableG (st : IRState) : Stmt → Prop
  | .assign _ e => e = .gas ∨ ∃ w, evalExpr st 0 e = some w
  | .sstore key value => (∃ kw, st.locals key = some kw) ∧ (∃ vw, st.locals value = some vw)
  | .call cs => (∃ cw, st.locals cs.callee = some cw) ∧ (∃ gw, st.locals cs.gasFwd = some gw)

/-- **Gas/call-aware run-definability** — the honest replacement of `RunDefinable`
(unsatisfiable on the gas/call domain, header lesson 4). Definability is threaded along
`RunStmts` derivations: at every cursor, the statement is definable at the state reached by
running the block prefix (any oracle, any trace, any block-entry state); the `ret` operand
and `branch` condition are bound at the post-statement state. SUPPLIED status: static per
program in the same over-approximate sense as the old bundle (state-uniform in the
block-entry state); decidable for concrete programs by running the fold — R9's checker
discharges it. -/
structure RunDefinableG (prog : Program) : Prop where
  /-- Every cursor's statement is definable at every state a `RunStmts` prefix-run reaches. -/
  stmts : ∀ (o : CallOracle) (st st' : IRState) (T T' : Trace) (L : Label) (b : Block)
      (pc : Nat) (s : Stmt),
    blockAt prog L = some b → b.stmts[pc]? = some s →
    RunStmts prog o st T (b.stmts.take pc) st' T' →
    StmtDefinableG st' s
  /-- A `ret t` block's operand is bound at every `RunStmts`-post state. -/
  ret_def : ∀ (o : CallOracle) (st st' : IRState) (T T' : Trace) (L : Label) (b : Block)
      (t : Tmp),
    blockAt prog L = some b → b.term = .ret t →
    RunStmts prog o st T b.stmts st' T' →
    ∃ w, st'.locals t = some w
  /-- A `branch cond _ _` block's condition is bound at every `RunStmts`-post state. -/
  branch_def : ∀ (o : CallOracle) (st st' : IRState) (T T' : Trace) (L : Label) (b : Block)
      (cond : Tmp) (thenL elseL : Label),
    blockAt prog L = some b → b.term = .branch cond thenL elseL →
    RunStmts prog o st T b.stmts st' T' →
    ∃ cw, st'.locals cond = some cw

/-- **Static `defsOf`-cursor consistency** (header lesson 6 — the review drill's shadowing
hole). Every def-site in the program text agrees with `defsOf`'s registration for its
target: a pure assign registers its own RHS; a gas/sload assign and a call result register
the spill slot `.slot (slotOf t)`.

GROUND TRUTH this pins (`Lowering.lean`): `defsOf` is a **FIRST-find over program order**
(`pairs.find?` returns the first match — NOTE its docstring says "the last assign", a
discrepancy flagged for a Wave-4 sweep; that file is not this track's edit surface), while
`emitStmt` keys its spill stash on `defsOf t`. A tmp redefined with mixed pure/spill defs
(e.g. `[.assign t (.imm 1), .assign t .gas]`) therefore emits NO GAS byte at the shadowed
def while `EvalStmt.assignGas` still demands a gas-stream head — the flagship refutation of
header lesson 6. This field excludes exactly that mismatch (including pure/pure shadowing
with a DIFFERENT RHS, which breaks recompute-on-use the same way); single-assignment
programs (`exProg`) satisfy it trivially, so benign programs stay in scope. It is the
static lift of the per-cursor `hself` side condition the DefsSound walk already consumes
(`defsSound_preserved_assignPure`, `DefsSound.lean:269`). SUPPLIED status: static,
decidable per program (the R9 checker's territory). -/
def DefsConsistent (prog : Program) : Prop :=
  ∀ (L : Label) (b : Block) (pc : Nat), blockAt prog L = some b →
    (∀ (t : Tmp) (e : Expr), b.stmts[pc]? = some (.assign t e) →
      defsOf prog t = some (match e with
        | .gas => .slot (slotOf t)
        | .sload _ => .slot (slotOf t)
        | e' => e'))
    ∧ (∀ (cs : CallSpec) (t : Tmp), b.stmts[pc]? = some (.call cs) → cs.resultTmp = some t →
      defsOf prog t = some (.slot (slotOf t)))

/-! ### Shadowing-aware scoping (header lesson 8 — the round-3 reshape)

`Lir.StepScoped`'s live-scope clause is a free-∀ over the CURRENT live set ("no bound
tmp's registered def reads the assign target") — define-before-use, which a LOOP violates
by construction on its second iteration (rebinding with live dependents; `exProg` block 1).
The shadowing-aware replacement (design route (i), carrier shape (b) — an explicit
invalidation set):

* `ReadsOf` — the STATIC registered-reader relation;
* `invalStep` — the per-statement invalidation-set transfer: rebinding `t` invalidates
  every registered reader of `t`; the rebound `t` itself is re-validated (unless its own
  def reads it). Liveness-INSENSITIVE by design: invalidating a reader that is not even
  bound is harmless (the invariant below claims nothing about unbound tmps), and it keeps
  the transfer a pure function of the program text and the statement — no state parameter,
  which is what makes the R0b preservation lemma side-condition-free;
* `DefsSoundS` — `DefsSound` restricted to the complement of the invalidation set: a
  stale-but-unused binding is CLAIMED NOTHING ABOUT until its reassign re-validates it
  (mid-block staleness of a bound-but-unused dependent is harmless to the lowered code:
  rematerialisation is exercised only at USE sites);
* `StepScopedS` — the static residue of `Lir.StepScoped` once the live-scope clauses move
  into the invalidation bookkeeping: state-FREE, derivable from `WellLowered`
  (`defsCons` + cursor membership), hence immune to the lesson-8 refutation;
* `RevalidatesPerBlock` — the static boundary criterion the R0b reshape rests on: folding
  `invalStep` over any present block's statements from the empty set lands back on the
  empty set, so the strong `DefsSound` (= `DefsSoundS` at `∅`, `defsSoundS_empty_iff`) is
  re-established at every block boundary — exactly where the ties consume `Corr`.

**Why carrier shape (b) over shape (a)** (a "validSince"/not-invalidated-since-binding
predicate over the walk): validity-since-binding is HISTORY-indexed — it cannot be stated
on a single `(prog, st)` pair without walk data, so it would carry the same set implicitly;
making the set explicit data with a STATIC transfer function costs one definition and buys
(i) a preservation lemma with no per-state side conditions (R0b — the live-scope demands
are gone, not relocated into hypotheses), and (ii) a decidable-in-principle boundary
criterion (`RevalidatesPerBlock`, the R9 checker's territory). A SEMANTIC invalidation
predicate ("live but stale") is NOT an option: it would make the scoped invariant a
tautology ("every non-stale binding recomputes"). -/

/-- `t'` is a **registered reader** of `t`: `t'`'s `defsOf`-registered def reads `t`.
Static (a fact of the program text); the invalidation unit of `invalStep`. -/
def ReadsOf (prog : Program) (t t' : Tmp) : Prop :=
  ∃ e', defsOf prog t' = some e' ∧ usesInExpr t e' ≠ 0

/-- **The invalidation-set transfer** of one statement. Rebinding `t` (an assign target or
a call result) invalidates every registered reader of `t`; `t` itself is re-validated by
the rebind (unless its own def reads it — a self-reading target stays invalid, harmlessly:
recompute-on-use never reproduces it, and no side condition is demanded anywhere).
`sstore` and result-free calls transfer the set unchanged: a world write invalidates NO
registered recompute — `defsOf` never registers a `.sload` (gas/sload/call results are all
routed to `.slot`, `Lowering.lean`), so no registered def reads the world. -/
def invalStep (prog : Program) (I : Tmp → Prop) : Stmt → (Tmp → Prop)
  | .assign t e => fun t' =>

      | some t => fun t' => if t' = t then False else (I t' ∨ ReadsOf prog t t')
      | none => I

/-- **Shadowing-aware recompute soundness**: `Lir.DefsSound` restricted to the tmps
OUTSIDE the invalidation set `I`. A stale-but-unused dependent (inside `I`) is claimed
nothing about — the lesson-8 repair: the un-scoped `DefsSound` is FALSE at `exProg`'s
real mid-block loop-exit states (`not_defsSound_stale`), while `DefsSoundS` at the
`invalStep`-threaded set is preserved with no per-state side conditions (R0b). -/

    st.locals t = some w → some w = evalExpr st 0 e

/-- At the EMPTY invalidation set, `DefsSoundS` is exactly the strong `DefsSound` — the
bridge between the mid-block scoped invariant and the block-boundary `Corr.defsSound` the
ties consume. PROVED (not debt). -/

  ⟨fun h t e w hd hn hl => h t e w hd hn not_false hl,
   fun h t e w hd hn _ hl => h t e w hd hn hl⟩

/-- **The static per-step scoping residue** — `Lir.StepScoped` minus the refutable
live-scope clauses (which moved into the invalidation bookkeeping) and minus pure-assign's
`usesInExpr t e = 0` self-read clause (absorbed: a self-reading rebind leaves its target
in the invalidation set instead of demanding a side condition). State-FREE: every clause
is a fact of the program text — the registration clause from `DefsConsistent` at the
cursor, `isGasDef`/`isSloadDef`/`isCallResult` from cursor membership, and the sstore
clause from `defsOf`'s structure (it never registers a `.sload`; true of ALL programs,
the `defsOf_ne_gas` twin). DERIVED status inside the ties: computable from `hwl` + the
cursor, never a live-set demand. -/

/-- **The per-block boundary re-validation criterion** (R0b's static half): folding the
invalidation transfer over any present block's statements from the EMPTY set lands back
on the empty set — every within-block invalidation is healed by a reassign before the
block ends, so the strong `DefsSound` is re-established at every block boundary (where
the ties consume `Corr.defsSound`). Static; decidable in principle once the tmp universe
is listed (the `Tmp → Prop` fold gets a `List Tmp` executable twin in the R9 checker).

embedded live-scope clause for the result tmp is refutable WITHIN the R10a hypothesis
envelope for any `WellLowered` program whose call result has a registered reader — not
at `exProg` itself, whose `t5` has none, but the disease shape is identical). Everything

scoping fold (derivable: prior-live tmps from the `Corr` antecedent's `wellScoped`,
locals untouched by the world swap; the result tmp from `DefsConsistent`'s call clause),
and the Route-B tail. The `obs` phantom is pinned to `0` (as everywhere in this file).
The copy is deliberate, recorded Phase-3 unification debt: the R0b reshape re-plumbs
`sim_call_stmt`'s input to this form and retires the in-tree original (this track edits

/-- **The honest oracle seams** (the flagship's `hseams`) — the precompile boundary, both
faces. `noErase` is verbatim the `hprec` hypothesis of `callPreservesSelf_modGuards`
(a live precompile's `.inr` result map genuinely can erase accounts — opaque, honestly
supplied; vacuous for non-precompile-targeting programs). `callsCode` is the reachable-CALL
targets-code residual (`V2/Modellable.lean`; NOT a lowering property — an IR call whose
callee materialises a precompile address would violate it; vacuous for call-free programs).
SUPPLIED status: the irreducible seam structure — both fields are satisfiable and
non-vacuous, and neither is dischargeable from the program text. (`prog` is carried for
signature stability — a future refinement scopes `callsCode` by the program's call sites.)
NON-VACUITY GUARD: `noErase` quantifies over ALL `CallParams` (a global engine fact), so
the flagship's whole hypothesis set is satisfiable only if the current exp003 `beginCall`
precompile stub actually preserves account presence — R12a deliberately DOUBLES as the
machine-check of that engine fact (its `PrecompileSeams exProg params` conjunct); a failure
there is diagnosed as a SEAM problem with the engine stub, not an `exProg` problem. -/

(`V2/RunLog.lean`): the function-shaped `CallOracle` cannot distinguish two dynamic calls
with identical IR-visible inputs but different EVM outcomes. R3′ records the tracked
generalization decision (calls as a consumed stream, mirroring the gas channel).
LOOP CAVEAT, CLOSED AT THE THEOREM SURFACE (header lesson 7): a syntactically-single call
INSIDE A LOOP can still fire dynamically more than once, and the head-projection oracle is
then wrong from the second firing on. This def stays syntactic; the DYNAMIC at-most-one
premise is the separate decidable log-side hypothesis `hone : log.calls.length ≤ 1`
carried by R3/R10a and the flagships (read off the run like `hclean`; satisfied by
`exProg`, whose call sits outside the loop). SUPPLIED status: static, decidable. -/

Static, decidable. Under it the realised gas stream plays no role (companion sorry:
`realisedGas_nil_of_noGasReads`), so the co-flagship needs no R1 — the de-risking
checkpoint (target-architecture decision 2). -/

`Runs`-reachable frame sitting at an SSTORE opcode with operands `kw :: vw :: rest` on the
stack writes a nonzero value. Needed because `sim_sstore_stmt`'s `hnz : vw ≠ 0` is the
nonzero-write scope of `EvalStmt.sstore` (zero writes are out of the current simulation's
scope). `Runs`-monotone (a suffix frame's reachable set is a subset), so the walk threads it
(`DriveCorrLog.nonzeroSstores`). SUPPLIED status: honest scope seam; tracked decision —
either extend `sim_sstore` to zero writes or record SSTOREs in the log. The op/stack shapes
mirror `sim_sstore_stmt`'s `hdop`/stack facts verbatim. -/

/-! ## §2 — The recorder-restart coupling (the hard design piece)

The tie reshape's carrier (target-architecture §3, SETTLED as option (i)): instead of the
free-`∀` value variables, the walk invariant carries ONE real coupling field — *restarting
the recording interpreter at the current top-level boundary frame reproduces the run's final
observable and exactly the un-consumed suffixes of the recorded streams*. The tie value
conjuncts then pin themselves to the SUFFIX HEAD, which the antecedent (restart determinism)
links to the run — no free VALUE variable survives. (The SCOPING conjuncts carried their own
copy of the disease, invisible to this §: the round-3 repair is header lesson 8 / `StepScopedS`.)

Design notes (each load-bearing):

* **`restart` is the load-bearing field**: `driveLog` is a deterministic function, so a
  restart equation from `fr` pins the suffixes AND `log.observable` simultaneously — an
  adversarial `(fr, suffix)` pair must actually reproduce the recorded future, which is
  what makes the R1-style head equations derivable rather than refutable.
* The restart uses pending stack `[]` because coupling is stated at TOP-LEVEL boundary
  frames only (`Corr.stack_nil` cursors) — the same `stack.isEmpty` gate `driveLog` records
  under.
* **Child calls are black-boxed correctly**: a descended CALL's internal GAS/SLOAD reads are
  invisible to the restart exactly as to the original recording (the `stack.isEmpty` gate),
  so `recorderCoupled_call` consumes exactly one `CallRecord` and NO gas/sload entries.
* **Cyclic-correct**: a loop revisits the same cursor with different gas; the coupling is
  indexed by the FRAME (whose gas differs per visit), never by the cursor — no per-cursor
  value function anywhere (the fatal flaw of the rejected option (iii)).
* The three prefix fields make "consumed so far" explicit (the R10 assembly reads them);
  the entry instance is the whole log with `pre = []` (`recorderCoupled_entry`). -/

/-- **Recorder-restart coupling.** Restarting the recording interpreter at the current
top-level boundary frame `fr` reproduces the run's final observable and exactly the
un-consumed suffixes of the recorded streams; each suffix is genuinely a suffix of its
recorded stream. SUPPLIED status: never supplied to the flagship — R7 establishes it at
entry and preserves it across steps/calls; the ties CONSUME it as an antecedent. -/

/-- **The recoupled walk invariant** — the future replacement of `DriveCorrPlus`'s four
dead accumulator lists (which are NOT edited here; Phase 3 proper swaps them). Carried at
every top-level block-entry boundary of the drive walk:

* `corr`/`cleanHalts` — the existing `DriveCorr` content (the cursor + the non-exception
  scope), with the phantom `obs` parameter pinned to `0` (audit-confirmed unused by `Corr`;
  slated for deletion in the Phase-3 reshape — NOT deleted here, no edits to existing files);
* `present` — the reached label is present (R8's consumer; kills the inside-out `hpresent`);
* `selfPresent`/`addrPin`/`kindPin` — decision-4's rfl-preserved companions: they are what
  KILLS the unsatisfiable `TermTies` stop/ret address/kind/nonempty conjuncts (those demands
  become antecedents supplied by this invariant, and non-emptiness is DERIVED via
  `accounts_ne_empty_of_selfPresent`);
* `nonzeroSstores` — the threaded scope seam (entry-seeded from the flagship's `hnzw`,
  preserved by `Runs`-monotonicity); it supplies the sstore arm's antecedent;
* `coupled` — the §2 recorder coupling at the un-consumed suffixes.

/-! ## §3 — The reshaped ties `StmtTies'` / `TermTies'` (R0 as statements; no free value-∀)

The five statement arms and four terminator arms of the former `StmtTies`/`TermTies`
(since-deleted; formerly `LowerConforms.lean:1273-1423`), re-stated so that every formerly-free
value variable is pinned by an antecedent:

* every arm's antecedent block is: cursor statement + `Corr` (phantom `obs := 0`) +
  `RecorderCoupled` + `CleanHaltsNonException`; the suffix variables are ∀-bound but
  antecedent-pinned through the (deterministic) restart equation — an adversarial witness
  must reproduce the recorded future, which is what makes the value conclusions derivable;
* the gas arm's free `ob = …` equation becomes `gS.head? = some …` (R1 supplies it);
* the sload arm's free `w` becomes the antecedent-pinned `st0.world kv` under
  `st0.locals k = some kv` (the planned `∃ w, evalExpr … = some w` conclusion was itself
  refutable by an empty-locals `Corr` witness — header lesson 5 — so the key binding is an
  antecedent, exactly as the sstore arm's operand bindings always were);
* the plain-assign arm's free `st0'` becomes the pinned post-state `st0.setLocal t w` under
  the `evalExpr st0 0 e = some w` antecedent (the `EvalStmt.assignPure` hypothesis), and the
  arm no longer fires on `.gas`/`.sload` (killing the static contradiction with `defsOf`'s
  spilling);
* the sstore arm DROPS `∃ acc, SstoreRealises fr0 kw vw acc` entirely (header lesson 3 —
  unsatisfiable); its content returns point-wise at the concrete frame (R4). Its `vw ≠ 0`
  conclusion is kept but under the threaded `NonzeroSstores fr0` antecedent (without it, an
  adversarial coupled zero-writing frame refutes the conclusion — the log does not record
  SSTOREs, so the coupling alone cannot pin the written value);
* the `TermTies` stop/ret address/kind demands become ANTECEDENTS (supplied by
  `DriveCorrLog`'s rfl-preserved pins), and non-emptiness is the only stop conclusion
  (derivable via `accounts_ne_empty_of_selfPresent`); the ret arm's bare
  `∃ vw, st'.locals t = some vw` conclusion is DROPPED (refutable by an empty-locals `Corr`
  witness; at real states `RunDefinableG.ret_def` supplies it) — the epilogue block is
  stated under the `∀ vw`-antecedent it always had, now strengthened with an explicit pc
  pin (`frv.pc = frT.pc + |materialise t|`) so its decode conclusions are static
  `DecodeAnchors` facts rather than claims about every stack-coincident frame;
* the jump/branch gas-guard conclusions are kept verbatim but now under the
  `CleanHaltsNonException frT` antecedent, which blocks the zero-gas refutation (skeptic
  sub-claim 4's strengthening) and makes them derivable by the
  `jump_landing_of_cleanHalt`/`branch_landing_of_cleanHalt` extractors;
* successor-presence conjuncts are gone from the ties (they live in `ClosedCFG`; the
  jump/branch arms take presence as antecedents, supplied by the walk from R8);
* **(round 3, header lesson 8)** every `Lir.StepScoped` conclusion (arms 1–4) is replaced
  by the static `StepScopedS`, and the call arm's `Lir.CallRealises` by `CallRealisesS`:
  the embedded live-scope clauses ("no bound tmp's registered def reads the target") were
  refutable at `exProg`'s own second loop iteration — block 1, pc 0 (`t6 := gas` vs the
  live `t8 ↦ lt t6 t7`) and pc 1 (`t7 := 1000` vs the same `t8`) — at real on-run states
  consistent with every antecedent. Staleness accounting moved to the invalidation set
  (`invalStep`/`DefsSoundS`, R0b); the ties now claim only the static residue.

SUPPLIED status of both defs: never supplied to the flagship — R10 BUILDS them from the
run (`stmtTies'_of_runWithLog`/`termTies'_of_runWithLog`). PRECISION NOTE on the arms'
conclusions (the round-2 review's overclaim fix — they are NOT all "computed from `fr0`
and restart determinism"): each conclusion is one of (i) a static fact of `prog`,
derivable from `hwl` + the cursor (the `StepScopedS`/registration/canonicity/
addressability/stack-fold/pc-bound conjuncts), (ii) a fact carried over from the arm's
own antecedents (the `setLocal`-scoping folds from `Corr.wellScoped` + `DefsConsistent`;
the post-assign `MemRealises` from `Corr.memAgree`; the sstore `vw ≠ 0` from the threaded
`NonzeroSstores` seam), or (iii) a value/trace fact computed from `fr0`/`frT` + restart
determinism under the clean-halt antecedent (the `gS.head?` equation, the CALL kernel,
the gas guards, the epilogue anchors). No conclusion depends on a variable that is not
antecedent-pinned or static — that is the honest residue of the "no free-∀" slogan. -/

docstring for the reshape rationale, arm by arm. `self` is consumed by the call arm's

/-! ## §4 — Exact stream consumption: `RunFromLeft` / `RunFromAll`

the last drop-the-suffix vacuity channel. `RunFromLeft` mirrors `RunFrom` constructor-for-
constructor with one extra `Trace` index exposing the leftover at the halt; `RunFromAll`
pins it to `[]` (the strengthening the target architecture marks "worth taking"). The two
adequacy lemmas make the mirror-faithfulness itself tracked debt. -/

/-- **R0b — the shadowing-aware machinery-reshape criterion** (header lesson 8; NEW
round-3 tracked obligation). One `EvalStmt` step of a PROGRAM statement preserves the
scoped invariant along the `invalStep` transfer — with NO per-state side conditions: the
live-scope demands of the retired `Lir.StepScoped` are GONE (absorbed by the set), not
relocated into hypotheses. The site premises (`hb`/`hs`) + `DefsConsistent` pin the
statement's registration (a foreign, non-program statement could rebind against `defsOf`
and refute the unpinned version — that drill was run on THIS statement too).

THE MACHINERY FINDING THIS TRACKS (why the reshape is an obligation, not an option): the
CURRENT sim machinery carries the un-scoped `DefsSound` at every statement cursor
(`Corr.defsSound`, `SimStmt.lean`) and so CANNOT traverse a loop-exit iteration of a
rebinding program — at `exProg`'s loop-exit iteration, between the `t6 := gas` rebind
(block 1, pc 0) and `t8`'s reassign (pc 2), the real mid-block state has `t8` stale and
`Corr` is FALSE there (`not_defsSound_stale` is the machine-check; the second-iteration
ENTRY states are fine, which is why the block-boundary `DriveCorrLog` survives). The
Phase-3 R0 reshape must therefore: (1) replace `Corr.defsSound` by `DefsSoundS` at an
`invalStep`-threaded set for the MID-BLOCK cursors of the `SimStmtStep` spine; (2)
re-establish the strong invariant at block boundaries via `RevalidatesPerBlock` +
`defsSoundS_empty_iff` (the boundaries are where the ties consume `Corr`); (3) re-plumb
the per-arm sim lemmas' `StepScoped`/`SstoreRealises`-style inputs to `StepScopedS` +
a use-site non-invalidation premise — a USE of an invalidated tmp is where IR-vs-lowered
divergence would be REAL (the lowered code rematerialises fresh, the IR reads stale), so
the static checks must exclude it; `RevalidatesPerBlock`-conforming programs whose
within-block uses precede the invalidating rebind (or follow the healing reassign, as
`exProg`'s branch use of `t8` does) are the honest domain. NOTE (round-3 review): the
ties' own mid-block `Corr` antecedents are themselves subject to criterion (1)'s carrier
swap — arms at stale-window cursors are un-fireable by the reshaped walk (strong `Corr`
is false at those real states), so the R10a→R11 assembly routes those cursors through
the re-plumbed sim lemmas or a scoped-`Corr` restatement of the arms. DERIVED-status
obligation (a lemma about the semantics; nothing supplied to the flagship). -/

/-- **R3 — call realisation from the log.** At a call cursor, the coupled frame's recorded
CALL supplies the `CallRealisesS` bundle at the REALISED oracle — the round-3 restatement
(header lesson 8): NOT the in-tree `Lir.CallRealises` verbatim (whose embedded
`StepScoped (.call cs)` live-scope clause is refutable within this theorem's own
hypothesis envelope for a `WellLowered` program whose call result has a registered
reader), but the value/trace KERNEL + the shadowing-aware static scoping (`StepScopedS`)
+ the static bundle the round-2 statement was MISSING (`hwl` — it is what derives the
`StepScopedS` residue, the result-tmp slot registration of the post-state fold, and the
Route-B slot addressability; the round-2 reviewer's "R3 carries no static bundle at all").
Kernel sources: the head `CallRecord` (`realisedCall_eq_evmV2`, rfl-clean once the record
is pinned), plumbing from `materialise_runs` + the `resumeAfterCall` rfl-pins + the
Route-B tail (`stash_tail_runs`).
Under `SingleCall` + the DYNAMIC at-most-one premise `hone : log.calls.length ≤ 1` the
head of the coupled `callSuffix` IS this cursor's call (the whole log records at most one
— `hone` is what makes that true of the RUN and not just the text: without it a
syntactically-single call in a loop fires per iteration and the head-projection oracle is
refuted at the second firing, header lesson 7). The address antecedent is what identifies
`realisedCall log self` with `evmV2CallOracle … fr0.address`. DERIVED-status obligation
(with `hseams`-style context available to the R10 assembly if the plumbing needs it).

**R3′ (tracked design decision, not a statement):** for multi-CALL programs the
function-shaped `CallOracle` is wrong (two dynamic calls with identical IR-visible inputs
can differ); the honest completion makes calls a CONSUMED STREAM of records — exactly the
gas channel's positional solution, and the coupling already carries `callSuffix` for it.
That generalization touches `EvalStmt.call` (IR spec surface) and is deliberately deferred;
`SingleCall` (and its loop caveat, see its docstring) is the recorded interim scope.

**STATUS (Phase-3 Round-3, R3 — honest partial; theorem stays `sorry`).** Piece A (oracle
identification from the recorder) is now LANDED, real and axiom-clean, as
`recorderCoupled_call_extract` (above): it PRODUCES the `CallReturns callFr resumeFr` witness and
the `rec = {result := childRes.toCallResult, pending}` record identity from the coupling at the
CALL cursor — the seedFuel-vs-restart-fuel reconciliation the plan under-specified is discharged
via `child_terminates` + `drive_fuel_mono` (Piece A is genuinely, not just nominally, unblocked by
R7e). `recorderCoupled_stepsTo_other` lands the Piece-A step-1 arg-push transport atom. With
`hone` collapsing `log.calls` to `[rec]` (`realisedCall_eq_evmV2`), Piece A discharges the
`o = evmV2CallOracle result pd …` conjunct and supplies `CallReturns` + `resumeFr`.

**BLOCKER — Piece B (the machine run) has no in-tree producer.** The bundle's arg-push run
conjuncts (`Runs fr0 callFr` + the pc/mem/activeWords pins + `decode callFr = CALL`) require a
`materialise`-driver that BUILDS the run from `Corr`/`hwl` (the five `emitImm 0` pushes then two
`materialise_runs_of_cleanHalt` calls, threading `MatDec`/`DefsSound`/`StorageAgree`/`MemRealises`
/`evalExpr`/stack-room from `Corr.memAgree`/`Corr.defsSound` + `hwl`). In-tree this run is only
ever SUPPLIED to `sim_call_stmt` (`SimStmt.lean:589` `hargs : Runs fr callFr`); no producing lemma
exists, so it must be written from scratch (~200 lines, precedent: the branch cond driver
`LowerDecode.lean:747`). Landing that driver also locates `callFr` and gives
`stepFrame callFr = .needsCall …` (feeding `recorderCoupled_call_extract`) and the Route-B tail
(`stash_tail_runs`). Secondary risk (plan §3.2): several `resumeAfterCall` frame-pins
(`resumeFr.exec.pc = callFr.exec.pc + 1`, `.stack`, `.memory`) may need a bytecode-layer
computation lemma about `resumeAfterCall` — that would live in the DEFAULT target, so per the
track rules it is STOP-and-report, not an in-`Nightly` edit. A partial `refine` supplying only the
Piece-A/C conjuncts would bury the Piece-B `sorry` in a mid-bundle position (a fake close the
review's statement-diff would flag), so R3 stays a single top-level `sorry` with Piece A landed as
the two helpers above. -/

**STATEMENT CHANGES (Phase-3 Round-3 — over-specification fixes, honesty-critical):**
  * **branch arm restricted to the WITNESSED direction.** The old arm demanded all six JUMPI
    gas guards along BOTH directions off the single pre-JUMPI frame; a single
    `CleanHaltsNonException frT` witnesses only the direction the run takes (JUMPI charges
    `Ghigh` on both arms, so the not-taken guards are refutable — e.g. `3 ≤ (jumpiFallthrough
    …).gas = Gjumpdest = 1` is FALSE when gas is provisioned for the taken path). The taken
    guards (`g1`/`g2` unconditional, both provable; `g3` under `cw ≠ 0`; `g4∧g5∧g6` under
    `cw = 0`) are the exact case-split of `branch_landing_of_cleanHalt`; NO witnessed
    conformance content is dropped — only the unwitnessable not-taken over-demand.
  * **ret charge-sum moved under the return-value guard.** The charge fold
    `materialise_charge_le_of_cleanHalt` needs the operand value, and the IR `ret t`
    semantics (`RunFrom.ret`) itself requires `st'.locals t = some vw`; demanding the
    charge-sum bound for an UNBOUND `t` is the same unwitnessable over-demand (the `.length`
    bound stays unconditional — it is static). The epilogue block (already under the value
    guard) is unchanged in placement.
  * **`hretEmit` added — the ret epilogue's pc-bound seam.** `WellFormedLowered.bound_ret`
    only bounds `termOf + |materialise t|` (the operand), NOT the 67-byte `PUSH32;PUSH32;
    RETURN` epilogue; the three epilogue decodes need `termOf + |materialise t| + 66 < 2^32`,
    which is a static, satisfiable, checker-dischargeable well-formedness fact absent from
    `bound_ret` (a default-target under-specification not editable here). Supplied as an
    explicit seam, NOT a vacuity dodge (it is genuinely true for every real ret block).
  * **`CallPreservesSelf` DERIVED, not added to the signature.** The ret `SelfPresent frv`
    bridge (across the adversarial `Runs frT frv`) is discharged from the already-present
    `hprec` via `callPreservesSelf_modGuards hprec` (axiom-clean); no seam added — a
    strengthening over the round-2 blocker's "add `CallPreservesSelf`" instruction. -/

/-! #### R7 machinery — the `driveLog` accumulator homomorphism (spine-owned)

`driveLog`'s three accumulators are WRITE-ONLY until the final `.inr []` read: every
recursive call only appends (gas/sload append a singleton, `recordCall` appends at the
tail). So a run from a nonempty seed is the empty-seed run with the seeds prepended to
every recorded stream. This is the linchpin of the R7 preservation family: it lets each
step lemma peel the recorded head off the empty-seed restart. -/

/-- `recordCall` appends its record at the tail, so prepending an accumulator commutes
with it: `recordCall pending result (c0 ++ x) = c0 ++ recordCall pending result x` at
`x = []`. -/

/-! ### R6 status — the geometry track's findings (Track A / the `hrb` residue)

**R6 WITHOUT a size side condition is REFUTABLE**, so its statement above now carries
`hne : 0 < prog.blocks.size` (blocker B1). The remaining side conditions are pinned below as
real, machine-checked lemmas (no `sorry`, no weakening of R6 itself — R6's own `sorry` above is
left untouched; these are the honest partial the geometry track lands).

* **Blocker B1 — the zero-block program (a CONCRETE counterexample, `not_runs_atReachableBoundary`), NOW FIXED on the statement.**
  For `prog.blocks = #[]`, `flatBytes prog = []` so `(flatBytes prog).length = 0`. `beginCall`
  still returns `.inl fr₀` (the `.Code` branch is total, pc `0`), and `Runs.refl fr₀` reaches
  `fr₀`, yet `AtReachableBoundary` demands `boundary < 0` — false. R6 therefore needs
  `0 < prog.blocks.size` on its statement (now added as `hne`); the refutation below proves R6's
  exact side-condition-free `∀`-form is false, justifying `hne`.
* **Blocker B2 — the oversized program / pc wrap.** The engine pc is `UInt32`, so every reachable
  boundary is `< 2 ^ 32`; but `ReachesBoundary`/`validJumpDests` are `Nat` walks that, for
  `(flatBytes prog).length > 2 ^ 32`, reach boundaries `≥ 2 ^ 32`. Matching the `Nat` walk back to
  the `UInt32` pc (taken-jump arm) and the no-wrap of the sequential/CALL advance both reduce to
  the program-size bound `(flatBytes prog).length ≤ 2 ^ 32` — natural (offsets are emitted as
  4-byte `PUSH4`) but absent from the statement and not derivable for a schematic `prog`.

The reusable geometry the `Runs`-induction is assembled from is landed green below:
`lower_size_eq`, the nonemptiness brick `flatBytes_length_pos` (→ B1's positive half), the entry
seed `atReachableBoundary_entry` (BASE, under `0 < prog.blocks.size`), and the `Runs`-induction
combinator `atReachableBoundary_of_runs` (parameterised on the per-`StepsTo`/`CallReturns` edge
lemmas — the STEP-PC dispatch walk + NEXT-IN-RANGE terminal-op geometry, the remaining engineering).

/-- **R6 — the boundary walk** (the `hrb` residue; the Track-A discharge target). Every
`Runs`-reachable frame of a `lower prog` entry sits at a reachable instruction boundary of
`lower prog` — the pc-reachability invariant that structurally discharges the no-CREATE
modellability clause (`notCreate_of_atReachableBoundary`) and scopes the future
data-segment design. One of the three substantial proofs. DERIVED-status obligation.

STATEMENT FIXED (R6 was REFUTABLE as originally stated — `not_runs_atReachableBoundary`)
with the two well-formedness side conditions the geometry track surfaced:
* B1 (`hne : 0 < prog.blocks.size`) — rules out the zero-block program the counterexample
  refutes; consumed by the entry seed. Legitimate: every real lowered program has an entry
  block, and B1 is exactly `ClosedCFG.entry_present`'s content (`entry.idx < blocks.size ⟹
  0 < blocks.size`). NOT vacuity-inducing: `beginCall` still returns `.inl fr₀`, `Runs.refl`
  still reaches the seed frame.
* B2 (`hsize : (flatBytes prog).length ≤ 2 ^ 32`) — the pc-wrap bound the taken-JUMP /
  sequential edge lemmas need to turn `boundary' < length` into the `boundary' < 2 ^ 32`
  conjunct. Legitimate: offsets are emitted as 4-byte `PUSH4`, so real programs fit the
  32-bit address space (the same bound the per-cursor `WellFormedLowered.bound_*` fields
  assert). An upper bound all real programs satisfy — not vacuity-inducing.

HONEST PARTIAL: the entry seed (`atReachableBoundary_entry`, consuming B1) and the
`Runs`-induction combinator (`atReachableBoundary_of_runs`) are wired here; the two edge
lemmas `hstep`/`hcall` remain the blocker — they need per-opcode `stepFrame` pc-geometry
bricks (next-pc = `nextInstrPosNat`/`validJumps`-member over the 16 `IsLoweringOp` arms, plus
the "blocks end in terminators ⇒ next instruction in range" in-range preservation, and the
`resumeAfterCall` pc = call-site pc + 1 fact) whose natural home is the default-target
`BoundaryReach.lean`/`NoCreateBytes.lean`, OUTSIDE this task's edit surface. B2 is threaded
into `hstep`/`hcall` (it is `decode_reachable_boundary_loweringOp`'s `hbound`). -/

/-- **R1 — the gas recorder bridge** (the riskiest obligation; the trace↔recorder
positional bridge). At a gas-assign cursor, the un-consumed gas suffix's head is the
machine GAS output at the cursor frame.

SATISFIABILITY ANALYSIS (why each hypothesis is load-bearing): the coupling's restart
equation pins `gS` to `fr`'s deterministic future; `Corr` (+ the two well-formedness side
conditions, below) pins `fr`'s pc/code to the GAS byte of `lower prog`; and the CLEAN-HALT
antecedent is what blocks the one remaining refutation — an OOG-at-GAS frame satisfies the
coupling with the run ending in an exception whose recorded suffix is `gS = []`, refuting
the head equation. Under clean halt the first restart step IS the recorded top-level GAS
read, and `driveLog` records exactly `UInt256.ofUInt64 exec.gasAvailable` of the
post-charge state (= `gasAvailable − Gbase`, the former `StmtTies` gas word — now the
`StmtTies'` gas arm — verbatim).

SIDE-CONDITION ADDITIONS (`hslotdef`/`hpcbound`, R6-style well-formedness — surfaced for
review, NOT a weakening): deriving the GAS decode from `Corr` requires that the gas assign
is actually *spilled to a slot* (`emitStmt` emits `[]` for a non-slotted `.assign t .gas`,
so the byte at the cursor would be the *next* op — the head equation is refutable without
it) and that the stash's pc range is in-bounds (`decode_gasstash`'s `+ 34 < 2^32`). Neither
is derivable from `Corr` (which pins only pc/code/stack, never the def-site byte, and never
a pc bound). Both are *exactly the sibling output conjuncts of the `StmtTies'` gas arm this
lemma feeds* (see the gas arm of `StmtTies'`), and the sole consumer
`stmtTies'_of_runWithLog` (R10a) carries `hwl : WellLowered prog`, whose `defsCons`
(`DefsConsistent`) discharges `hslotdef` while proving that very arm — so R10a has both
facts in hand at this call site. This mirrors the interface of `decode_gasstash` /
`sim_assign_gas_lowered` and of the closed `defsSoundS_preserved_step` (R0b), which takes
`DefsConsistent`. DERIVED-status obligation: never supplied. -/

/-- **R7e — a returning external CALL consumes exactly one `CallRecord` and NO gas/sload
entries** (children are black-boxed by the recorder's gates — gas/sload by `stack.isEmpty`,
the returning-CALL record by `rest.isEmpty` — exactly as `Runs.call` black-boxes them).

RESOLVED (2026-07-03, recorder-fix) — resolution (A) taken (the Phase-3 course-correction):
the returning-CALL record in `Spec/Recorder.lean`'s delivery branch is now gated on the
resumed pending stack being empty (`rest.isEmpty`), so it fires ONLY for the top-level
program's own returning CALL, matching the gas/sload `stack.isEmpty` gates and the recorder's
docstrings. With that gate this statement is TRUE AS WRITTEN — it carries no `hone` and needs
none (the single-call `hone` hypothesis was DROPPED): the gate excludes a descended callee's
inner calls STRUCTURALLY (they resume on a nonempty `rest`), regardless of the child's own
call count, so the earlier "1 + child call count" escalation/asymmetry note is gone, and
`realisedCall` is faithful even when the top-level call's callee itself calls — which is what
unblocks the R3′ multi-call generalization. (The orthogonal `hone` premises on
R3/R10a/the flagships guard the multiple-TOP-level-calls case, where `callOracleOf` reads
only the head record; they are untouched.)

Proof: unpack the restart from `fr` (`hcp.restart`) one CALL step — `fr` descends into
`child` on the pending stack `[.call pending]` (`hstep`/`hcode`). The child terminates within
the restart's fuel (`child_ne_oof_of_framed` from the framed run's success, result reconciled
with `hcr`'s black-box `childRes` by `drive_fuel_mono`). `driveLog_frame_nonempty` then shows
the inline child records nothing on the nonempty stack, and the outer delivery (`rest = []`)
records exactly `[outerRec]` and resumes at `resumeFr`. `driveLog_acc_hom` peels that single
seeded record, exposing the restart of `resumeFr` at suffixes `(gS, sS, cS)` — the coupling. -/

/-- **R7e′ — the coupling's CALL extraction** (R3's Piece-A atom; the *producing* companion of
`recorderCoupled_call`, which only consumes). At a top-level boundary frame `callFr` whose next
step is a returning external CALL (`stepFrame callFr = .needsCall cp pending`, `beginCall cp =
.inl child`), if the coupled call-suffix is `rec :: cS`, then that record is EXACTLY this CALL's
`{result := childRes.toCallResult, pending}`, the machine-side `CallReturns callFr resumeFr`
witness holds at the realised resume frame `resumeFr = resumeAfterCall childRes.toCallResult
pending`, and the coupling survives at `resumeFr` on the tail `cS`.

The `CallReturns` witness is genuinely PRODUCED here, not supplied: `child_terminates`
(`messageCall_never_outOfFuel`) gives the child's standalone seed-fuel termination
`drive (seedFuel cp.gas) [] (running child) = .ok childRes`, and `drive_fuel_mono` reconciles it
with the coupling's shared-restart-fuel child result — closing the seedFuel-vs-restart-fuel gap
that blocks reading `CallReturns` off the coupling alone (the reason `recorderCoupled_call` had to
take it as a hypothesis). The record identity is peeled from the restart equation exactly as in
`recorderCoupled_call`'s body (`driveLog_frame_nonempty` black-boxes the child, the `rest = []`
delivery records the one record, `driveLog_acc_hom` peels it), only here the head equation is
re-exposed instead of discarded. This is what makes `realisedCall log self` identifiable with the
realised oracle at R3's call cursor (via `realisedCall_eq_evmV2` once `hone` collapses
`log.calls` to `[rec]`). -/

/-! ## §6 — the concrete non-vacuity witness (R9's anchor; R12's subject)

`exProg` exercises every interesting feature at once: a gas read feeding a forwarded-gas
CALL (gas introspection coupled to the call channel), a spilled SLOAD, a nonzero SSTORE, a
single syntactic CALL (outside the loop — see `SingleCall`'s loop caveat), and a genuine
CYCLE (block 1 loops on a gas-derived condition until gas drops below the threshold — the
cyclic-driver domain no per-cursor gas function could handle). Block/tmp layout:

* block 0: `t0 := 5; t1 := gas; t2 := sload t0; t3 := 1; sstore t0 t3; t4 := 0x100;`
  `t5 := call(callee := t4, gasFwd := t1); jump L1`
* block 1 (the loop): `t6 := gas; t7 := 1000; t8 := (t6 < t7); branch t8 L2 L1`
* block 2: `stop` -/

/-! ### R9 — the `RunStmts` prefix-binding inversion (the named blocker)

`RunDefinableG`'s three fields quantify over ALL `RunStmts` prefix-runs and demand the
statement's operands be bound at the reached state. The missing brick is a `RunStmts`
binding inversion: a tmp assigned somewhere in the run's statement list is bound at the
run's final state. Two real inductions (no `sorry`/`decide`-escape):

* `runStmts_preserves_bound` — boundness is preserved across a whole `RunStmts` run (every
  `EvalStmt` case only ever `setLocal`s / `setStorage`s, never unbinds);
* `runStmts_binds_assign` — an `assign t e` occurring in the run's list leaves `t` bound at
  the final state (it binds `t` via `setLocal` at its own step, then preservation carries it
  through the suffix). -/

/-- `setLocal` binds its own target: reading back the set tmp yields the set value. -/
private theorem setLocal_self (st : IRState) (t : Tmp) (v : Word) :

`st.setLocal t₀ v` (the `t = t₀` branch binds it to `v`, the `t ≠ t₀` branch keeps it). -/

/-- **The `Conforms` channel — CLOSED assembly** (the flagship's world-channel conclusion,
factored out and reused by all three flagships). Given the run's terminal world equation
(the coupled driver's output: SOME halting terminal `(last, haltSig)` reachable from the
entry frame whose `observe`-world equals `O.world`) together with the modellability facts
`hrb`/`hcc`, the recorded `log.observable` is exactly that terminal's `endFrame`, so
`O.world = (observe self log.observable).world` — i.e. `Conforms self log O`.

Pure re-use of R2's internal machinery (`runWithLog_drive` + `runs_of_drive_ok` +
`runs_halt_eq` + `Runs.linear_to_halt`), exactly as `haltNonException_of_cleanLog` uses it:
the drive-adequacy pins `log.observable = endFrame last₀ halt₀` for the run's ACTUAL
terminal, and halting-terminal uniqueness identifies `(last, haltSig)` with
`(last₀, halt₀)`. This is the "static folds and assembly" half of R11 — genuinely closeable
now (axiom-clean), independent of the missing run-producer. The flagships feed it `hrb` (R6
boundary walk) and `hcc` (`hseams.callsCode`); the world equation comes from the run. -/
