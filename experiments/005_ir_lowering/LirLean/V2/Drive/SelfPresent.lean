# LirLean v2 — the recorded-run value-channel discharges + `SelfPresent` (`Drive/SelfPresent`)

The recorder/IR-coupled half of the former `V2/TieDischarge.lean` §1–§5 (decl names and
namespaces unchanged):

* **§1 CALL** — `realisedCall_projection`: the recorded-CALL projection IS `evmV2CallOracle`
  (the `o = evmV2CallOracle …` conjunct of `CallRealises`, discharged from the recording).
* **§2 GAS** — the alignment-free arithmetic bridge (`gasRecord_eq_gasReadOf`,
  `gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs`).
* **§3 GAS alignment** — the positional-alignment foundation `GasLogAligned` + the per-op
  step lemmas and the single-`obs` collapse `gasRealises_obs_of_witness`.
* **§4 SLOAD** — the warmth-charge bridge (`sloadRecord_discharges_obs`) and its positional
  twin `SloadLogAligned` + `sloadRealises_charge_of_witness`.
* **§5 SSTORE presence** — the world invariant `SelfPresent` with its non-emptiness bridge
  (`accounts_ne_empty_of_selfPresent`, via `Engine/AccountMap.lean`'s `find?_some_ne_empty`),
  the structural call-resume closer `resumeAfterCall_self_of_accounts`, and the entry-frame
  base case `selfPresent_codeFrame`.

The `SelfPresent`-forward closure along `Runs` (`StepPreservesSelf`/`CallPreservesSelf` and
the `callPreservesSelf` chain over `Engine/DriveMono.lean`'s Brick D) lives in
`Drive/CallPreservesSelf.lean`; the `DriveCorrPlus` walk and the headlines live in
`Drive/Headline.lean`.

No `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`; axioms `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-! ## §1 — CALL: the recorded-CALL projection is `evmV2CallOracle` (DISCHARGED)

`realisedCall log self` is, when the log recorded a CALL, exactly `evmV2CallOracle` at that record
(`realisedCall_eq_evmV2`). So `CallRealises`'s realised-oracle conjunct `o = evmV2CallOracle …` is
produced from the recording, not supplied. We re-expose it as the named value-channel discharge. -/

/-- **CALL value-channel discharge.** With the run's recorded CALLs led by `rec`, the realised
oracle is `evmV2CallOracle rec.result rec.pending self` — the `resumeAfterCall` projection. This is

(`realisedCall_eq_evmV2`, `simp`-clean), not supplied. -/

/-! ## §2 — GAS: the arithmetic bridge (alignment-free, DISCHARGED)

The recorded read at a top-level GAS `.next` step and the word the per-cursor `obs`-form
`Lir.GasRealises` demands are the **same** `UInt256.ofUInt64 (gasAvailable − Gbase)`, with no
appeal to alignment — pure `gasPost`/`gasFrame` arithmetic. -/

/-- The recorded GAS word at a `current` whose GAS step is `stepFrame current = .next exec` is
exactly `gasReadOf (gasFrame current)`: the recorder appends `UInt256.ofUInt64 exec.gasAvailable`,
and for a GAS op `exec = gasPost current.exec`, so `{ current with exec := exec } = gasFrame
current` and the appended word is its `gasReadOf`. -/

/-- The word `gasReadOf (gasFrame fr)` is exactly the value the per-cursor `obs`-form
`Lir.GasRealises obs fr` demands at the **pre-charge** frame `fr`: both are
`UInt256.ofUInt64 (fr.exec.gasAvailable − UInt64.ofNat Gbase)`. So once the alignment supplies that
the GAS cursor's `obs` is this recorded read, `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` at the cursor frame is
`rfl`-discharged (the universal-over-`g` form additionally needs the alignment's
all-same-address-frames-agree fact — the §3 obstacle). -/

/-! ## §3 — the positional-alignment foundation (Part 3, STARTED)

The coupling between the recorder's gas accumulator and the GAS-frames the drive walk visits, and
the foundational per-op step that advances both in lockstep. We reuse `Oracle.GasRealises`'s
witness shape (`T = frs.map gasReadOf ∧ FramesRun frs`) directly. -/

/-- **The gas-log alignment invariant.** A `driveLog` accumulator `gasAcc` is *aligned* with a
witness list of GAS-frames `frs` (the post-charge frames at each recorded GAS site, in program
order, `Runs`-threaded) when it is exactly their reported words. This is `Oracle.GasRealises` read
as an invariant on the recorder's accumulator: `gasAcc = frs.map gasReadOf` (positional
read-equality) together with `FramesRun frs` (the frames `Runs`-threaded). The drive walk threads
this alongside the `DriveCorr` cursor; §3's foundational steps show one op preserves it. -/

/-- **`FramesRun` extends on the right by a `Runs`-reachable frame.** Appending a frame `g`
reachable (`Runs last g`) from the current last frame `last` of a non-empty `Runs`-threaded list
keeps it `Runs`-threaded. The structural step the GAS-record arm uses to grow the witness list. -/

/-- **Foundational per-op step — the GAS-record arm.** At a top-level GAS `.next` step
(`stepFrame current = .next exec`, `current.stack = []` so the recorder's `isGasOp && stack.isEmpty`
gate fires), the recorder appends one word and the witness list one frame, in lockstep:
the new accumulator `gasAcc ++ [UInt256.ofUInt64 exec.gasAvailable]` is aligned with
`frs ++ [gasFrame current]`, provided the current witness list ends at a frame from which
`current` (hence `gasFrame current`) is reachable (`Runs`-threaded). The appended word is exactly
`gasReadOf (gasFrame current)` (`gasRecord_eq_gasReadOf`), so read-equality extends; `FramesRun`
extends by `FramesRun.snoc`. -/

verbatim. This is the common case the walk-induction threads between GAS cursors (every non-GAS op,
and GAS reads inside a descended CALL where `stack ≠ []`). -/

/-! ### Projecting list-level alignment back to a per-cursor `obs` tie

`Oracle.GasRealises (frs.map gasReadOf) frs` (which `GasLogAligned gasAcc frs` packages, with
`gasAcc = frs.map gasReadOf`) is the *list*-level realisability. The §7 per-cursor tie is the
`obs`-form `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` at each GAS cursor `fr`. The bridge for a single read is
`gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs`: at the GAS cursor frame, the matching list entry `gasReadOf (gasFrame
fr)` is the `obs` value the cursor tie demands. The reduction to alignment is then exactly: pick
the witness frame `frs[i]` for the `i`-th GAS cursor (the alignment's positional pairing) and read
off its `gasReadOf` as that cursor's `obs`. -/

-- RETAINED for Phase 3 realisability closure (audit §3)
/-- **The list→cursor read bridge.** The `i`-th entry of an aligned accumulator is the `obs` value
the §7 tie demands at the `i`-th GAS cursor frame `gasFrame fr` — i.e. `GasLogAligned`'s positional
read at a GAS site is exactly `Lir.GasRealises`'s required word there. The per-cursor tie is thus
the alignment's positional read, modulo the walk-induction that pairs cursor `i` with witness frame
`i` (the §3 obstacle). -/

/-! ### The single-`obs` collapse (the `Corr`-model–compatible alignment, DISCHARGED)

The `Corr` invariant the whole `sim_*` block walk threads (`SimStmt.lean`) carries a **single
fixed `obs : Word`** in `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` (`MaterialiseRuns.lean`), universal over every
same-address frame: `∀ g, g.addr = fr.addr → obs = ofUInt64 (g.gasAvailable − Gbase)`. The IR's
`evalExpr st obs .gas = some obs` reads that *same* `obs` for **every** `Expr.gas` (`Machine.lean`).
So within the `Corr` model the realised gas value is one word for the whole run — the recorded list
`log.gas` is positionally selected by `aligned_read_eq_obs` only when its aligned witnesses all
report that one word (e.g. a run with a single top-level GAS read).

`gasRealises_obs_of_witness` discharges exactly that: from the single-`obs` tie at a GAS cursor and
an alignment whose witness frame at index `i` is that cursor's post-charge `gasFrame`, the
positionally-selected recorded read `gasAcc[i]` **is** `obs`. This closes the GAS selection
end-to-end *for the `Corr` model the construction actually uses* — the recorded read at the cursor's
position is the cursor's `obs`. (The complementary direction — building the universal `obs`-form tie
from a *multi-entry* aligned list with distinct reads — is impossible in the single-`obs` model and
needs the `Corr` refactor to a per-cursor gas stream; reported as the standing obstacle.) -/

-- RETAINED for Phase 3 realisability closure (audit §3)
/-- **The single-`obs` selection discharge.** At a GAS cursor frame `fr` carrying the `Corr`-model
gas tie `Lir.GasRealises obs fr` (the universal-over-same-address form), if the alignment's witness
frame at index `i` is `fr`'s post-charge `gasFrame fr` (which shares `fr`'s address, `rfl`), then the
positionally-selected recorded read `gasAcc[i]` **is** `obs` — the cursor's gas observation. The §7
GAS per-cursor selection, discharged end-to-end in the single-`obs` model the block walk threads:
`aligned_read_eq_obs` gives `gasAcc[i] = ofUInt64 (fr.gas − Gbase)`, and the tie at the witness frame
`gasFrame fr` (same address) gives that word `= obs`. -/

/-! ## §4 — SLOAD: the recorded warmth-charge bridges `SloadRealises` (value channel)

Piece 1 added the per-SLOAD warmth recording to the interpreter (`RunLog.sloads`,
`driveLog`'s `sloadAcc`, `realisedSload`, `sloadWarmthOf`) with adequacy preserved by
construction (`driveLog_drive` still erases every accumulator). The value-level bridge
`sloadRecord_eq_sloadCost` (`V2/RunLog.lean`) shows the recorded charge at an SLOAD frame
*is* `SloadRealises`'s required `sloadCost (accessedStorageKeys.contains (self, key))` —
the exact analogue of `gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs` for GAS. So the SLOAD value channel is
now at the **same** maturity as GAS: arithmetic/value bridge DISCHARGED, per-cursor
selection reduced to the (deferred) positional alignment (`GasLogAligned`'s SLOAD twin).

We re-expose the bridge as the named SLOAD value-channel discharge and a per-cursor
reduction lemma (parallel to `aligned_read_eq_obs`): once the alignment supplies that the
SLOAD cursor's recorded charge is this site's `sloadWarmthOf`, the `sloadChg k =
sloadCost …` conjunct of `SloadRealises` is `rfl`-discharged at that frame. -/

/-- **SLOAD value-channel discharge** (parallel to `gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs`). The
recorded warmth-charge `sloadWarmthOf g` at an SLOAD frame `g` whose stack-head is the
bound key is exactly `SloadRealises`'s demanded `sloadCost (accessedStorageKeys.contains
(self, key))`. This is the value the recorder now logs (Piece 1); the per-cursor tie is
its positional selection (the deferred alignment, as for GAS). -/

  sloadRecord_eq_sloadCost g hkey

/-! ### §4.1 — the SLOAD positional-alignment invariant `SloadLogAligned` (GAS twin)

The exact SLOAD analogue of §3's `GasLogAligned`. The recorder logs each top-level SLOAD's
warmth-charge `sloadWarmthOf current` at the **pre-step** frame `current` (the `sloadAcc` splice in
`driveLog`, gated by `isSloadOp current && stack.isEmpty`). So the SLOAD witness list is the list
of **pre-step** SLOAD frames the drive walk visits, and the invariant couples the recorder's
`sloadAcc` to their reported warmth-charges: `sloadAcc = frs.map sloadWarmthOf` together with
`FramesRun frs` (the SLOAD frames `Runs`-threaded in program order).

Note the witness-frame asymmetry with GAS: GAS records `ofUInt64 exec.gasAvailable` (the
**post**-charge gas), so its witness frame is `gasFrame current` (the post-charge frame); SLOAD
records `sloadWarmthOf current` (read off `current`'s **pre**-step substate / stack), so its witness
frame is `current` itself. The lockstep step (`sloadLogAligned_step_sload`) and the list→cursor
bridge (`alignedSload_read_eq_obs`) mirror §3 one-for-one. -/

/-- **The sload-log alignment invariant** (GAS twin of `GasLogAligned`). A `driveLog`
`sloadAcc` accumulator is *aligned* with a witness list of SLOAD pre-step frames `frs` when it is
exactly their reported warmth-charges (`sloadWarmthOf`, in program order) and the frames are
`Runs`-threaded (`FramesRun frs`). The drive walk threads this alongside `DriveCorr`; the
foundational steps below show one op preserves it. -/

top-level SLOAD `.next` step (`current.stack = []`, so the recorder's `isSloadOp && stack.isEmpty`
gate fires), the recorder appends one warmth-charge `sloadWarmthOf current` and the witness list one
frame `current`, in lockstep: the new accumulator `sloadAcc ++ [sloadWarmthOf current]` is aligned
with `frs ++ [current]`, provided the current witness list ends at a frame from which `current` is
reachable (`Runs`-threaded). The appended word is *definitionally* `sloadWarmthOf current` (the
recorder logs exactly the witness frame's `sloadWarmthOf`, no `gasPost`-style post-step shift), so
read-equality extends by `rfl`; `FramesRun` extends by `FramesRun.snoc`. -/

when the witness frame at `i` is an SLOAD frame `g` whose stack-head is the bound key, the recorded
`sloadAcc[i]` is exactly `sloadCost (accessedStorageKeys.contains (self, key))`
(`sloadRecord_eq_sloadCost`). The per-cursor SLOAD tie is thus the alignment's positional read,

/-! ## §5 — SSTORE: the account-presence world invariant `SelfPresent` (standalone discharge)

`SstoreRealises`'s third conjunct (`accounts.find? self = some acc`) is **not** a dispatch
gate (SSTORE reads storage through `.option 0`, so it cannot come from step-inversion). It
is a *world-wellformedness* fact: the executing (self) account is present in the frame's
accounts throughout the run. We discharge it from a standalone invariant `SelfPresent`.

`SelfPresent fr` says the self account is present in `fr`'s accounts. It holds at the entry
`codeFrame` under world-wellformedness (the called account is present — code is loaded from
it; `selfPresent_codeFrame`), and it is preserved by every materialise post-frame
(`addFrame`/`ltFrame`/`sloadFrame`/`gasFrame`/`pushFrameW` — the `.next` building blocks the
SSTORE arm's internal frame `frk` is reached through), each of which leaves `accounts`
untouched (`rfl`). The remaining wiring — threading `SelfPresent` through the
`materialise_runs`/`MatRuns` sub-runs alongside the existing clauses — is the analogue of
§3's walk-induction (reported below). The **point-of-use** discharge turns `SelfPresent` at the SSTORE frame into exactly the presence conjunct
`SstoreRealises`/`sim_sstore` consumes there (`hsstore frk … |>.2.2`). -/

The halt terminator arms (built directly in `driveStepPlus_of_block`) must emit the `¬ (accounts == ∅)` conjunct

is present in the map, so the map cannot be empty). The account-map fact is
`find?_some_ne_empty` (a `find?` hit forces `¬ (m == ∅)`), a pure engine brick that lives in
`Engine/AccountMap.lean` together with its RBMap prims (`forM_from_nil`/`all2_nil_false`). -/

resumed frame keeps the self account present. Definitional: `resumeAfterCall` sets `exec.accounts :=
result.accounts` and leaves `executionEnv` (hence `.address`) at the suspended caller's value — the
hypothesis IS the conclusion up to `rfl`. This is the half of `CallPreservesSelf` that
does **not** depend on the open `drive_accounts_find_mono`; the `.success` shape still does (and so the

has it (`params.accounts.find? recipient = some _`) — the natural wellformedness assumption
(you run code *from* an existing account): the credit branch re-inserts it. (`codeAccounts`
may also create it when `value ≠ 0`; we take the present-in-`params.accounts` form, the one
a wellformed top-level call satisfies.) -/

/-- **`SelfPresent` at the entry frame** under world-wellformedness. If the called account
`params.recipient` is present in the pre-call world, it is present in the entry
`codeFrame`'s accounts (`codeAccounts` re-inserts the credited recipient), so
`SelfPresent (codeFrame params code)`. The base case of the reachability invariant. -/
