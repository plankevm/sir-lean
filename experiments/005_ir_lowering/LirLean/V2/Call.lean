# LirLean v2 — a worked external-`Stmt.call` example (gas-free, abstract oracle)

The call-free prototype (`LirLean/V2/Preserve.lean`) and the two-read milestone
(`LirLean/V2/Mono.lean`) exercise the gas channel — the supplied gas-read *sequence*.
This file is the companion for the **call channel**: the `Stmt.call` `EvalStmt` arm of
`LirLean/V2/Machine.lean`, run under an **arbitrary abstract `CallOracle`**
(`docs/ir-design-v3.md` §3, §7).

It is **frame-free** — it imports only `LirLean.V2.Law` (hence `Machine`/`IR`/`Evm`), no
`BytecodeLayer`/`Frame`/`Runs`. The oracle stays a parameter; the v1 `evmCallOracle`
instantiation (the realisability witness) is a separate, later piece.

The point it makes (the §7 interaction model, on the call side):

* a call is a **function oracle** of the call's IR-visible inputs (here: callee address
  and gas-to-forward), queried at the call site, returning the `(world', success)`
  bundle the semantics **applies as a state change** — `world := world'`, and the success
  flag bound straight into `locals` at `resultTmp` (**no `callResult` slot**);
* it is **gas-free** — the bundle carries no restored gas; the call touches no gas
  notion. Post-call gas reads, if any, still come from the gas sequence;
* the two channels **coexist**: the program also reads `Expr.gas` (a gas read) and
  feeds that observed word to the call as the gas-to-forward input.

The example mirrors the prototype's `proto_IRRun` style — hand-assembled `EvalStmt`s
chained into a `RunStmts`, closed by a `RunFrom.ret`.

/-! ## The program

One block (the entry), with one external `Stmt.call`. In order:

```text
t0 := 42            -- the callee address (an immediate, for concreteness)
t1 := gas           -- gas-to-forward = the observed GAS value (a gas read)
call(callee=t0, gasFwd=t1, result=t2)   -- query the oracle, bind success → t2
ret t2              -- return the success flag
```

The `t1 := gas` / `call …` pair is the deliberate coexistence of the two channels: the
gas value travels through the supplied gas read, and is then handed to the call as
an ordinary IR-visible input. -/

  { stmts :=

      , .assign (tmp 1) .gas
      , .call { callee := tmp 0, gasFwd := tmp 1, resultTmp := some (tmp 2) } ]

/-- `WellFormed` sanity check (B3): the two non-recomputable tmps — the gas read `t1`
(used once, as the call's `gasFwd`) and the call-result `t2` (used once, as `ret t2`) —
are each used at most once. Discharged via the decidable surrogate `WellFormedDec`. -/

The whole run halts returning the success flag the oracle produced, in the world the
oracle produced — both **read off the oracle**, never computed in the IR. -/

oracle `o`, initial world `w₀` and observed gas `obs`, `callIR` consuming the single
gas read `obs` halts with `callObsResult o w₀ obs`: the gas read feeds the call's
gas-to-forward input, the oracle's `(world', success)` bundle is applied as the state
change, and the success flag is returned. The oracle is held abstract throughout. -/
