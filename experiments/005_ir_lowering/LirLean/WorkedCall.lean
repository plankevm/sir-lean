# LirLean — the worked single-call program `Runs` assembly (C3d)

This module assembles the concrete `Runs` for the worked single-call program
`Lir.Decode.workedCall`, running it as a top-level `messageCall` over the
caller/callee world of exp003 (`BytecodeLayer.Programs`, whose `accts` carries the
`0xCA11EE` callee with its `calleeProg` code), and discharges
`lower_preserves` across `messageCall_runs`.

## What is proved here (C3d)

* `wc_begin` — the lowered program enters as code (`EntersAsCode`), giving the
  concrete entry frame `wcFrame g = codeFrame (wcParams g) (lower workedCall)`.
* `wc_prefix_runs` — **the genuine straight-line prefix run**: from the entry frame,
  the lowered opcodes of block 0 up to (and including pushing the seven CALL args)
  `Runs` to the CALL-site frame `wcCallSite g`. This is a real `Runs.trans` chain of
  the exp003 opcode rules (`runs_jumpdest`, `runs_push`, `runs_sstore`) instantiated
  on the concrete `lower workedCall` byte stream — decode at every pc is the
  offset-table address, reduced in the kernel; gas threads through `subCharges`
  exactly as `CallerProgExample.caller_prefix_runs`.
* `wc_call_step` — the CALL step at `wcCallSite g` (`stepFrame_call`).
* `wc_preserves` — **`lower_preserves` for `workedCall`** (the bridge half): the
  prefix, the genuine external CALL (`wc_callReturns`), and the whole post-CALL run
  (`wcPostRun` — fire-and-forget `POP`, branch recompute, taken `JUMPI`, block-1
  recompute) are all concrete; given the terminal `RETURN` halt `hhalt`, the top-level
  `messageCall` pins to `wcRetFrame g`'s halt result. This consumes
  `lower_preserves_discharge` over the assembled prefix + the `Runs.call` node, exactly
  the `Examples.TwoCallExample.twoCall_messageCall` shape, specialised to the single
  worked CALL of `workedCall`.

## The branch terminator — now CLOSED (Track A `validJumpDests` detotalization)

The post-CALL branch terminator is **no longer a remainder**. Track A detotalized
`validJumpDests` (it is now a total, kernel-reducible def with the characterization
lemma `mem_validJumpDests_of_reachable_jumpdest`), so the branch destination obligation
`Frame.get_dest 415 = some 415` is discharged axiom-cleanly here as `wc_get_dest_415`
(via `Frame.get_dest_of_mem` + a `ReachesBoundary (lower workedCall) 0 415` walk,
`wc_reaches_415`). No `native_decide`, no hypothesis. (Previously this was blocked by
`validJumpDests` being a `partial def`, the same wall that forced
`Examples.BranchExample` to build its JUMPI frame with an explicit `validJumps`.)

## The concrete child `CallReturns` — now CLOSED (C3f)

The child `CallReturns` (the C3e documented #1 blocker) is **closed**: `wc_callReturns`
is a genuine, hypothesis-free `CallReturns (wcCallSite g) (wcResumed g)` (for
`g ≥ 50000`). It builds the real child `drive` run of the `0xCA11EE` callee
(`PUSH1 5; PUSH1 7; SSTORE; STOP`) at the 63/64-capped CALL-site gas, over the
**post-SSTORE** parent world. The kernel-cost wall (the call-site `accounts` being the
post-SSTORE world threaded through `sstorePost` over the deep `lower workedCall`
computation) is defeated by the exp003 NAMED-LEMMA pattern: a `g`-independent
`wcStoredAccounts` (built from `callerXfer` + the self write, NO `lower` dependence)
plus `sstore_accounts_congr`, so the post-SSTORE world / SSTORE charge / cold floor are
derived from cheap code-free field facts, never by whole-map reduction. `wc_preserves`
no longer takes `hcall`.

## Post-CALL run CLOSED; only the terminal-`RETURN` operand shape remains (Route B)

The whole interior post-CALL run is discharged in-file as `wcPostRun`: the
fire-and-forget `POP` (Route B's `resultTmp = none` tail, discarding the CALL success
flag via `runs_pop`), then the block-0 branch-condition recompute (`SLOAD; ADD; LT`,
the taken `JUMPI` via `wc_get_dest_415` through Track A's detotalized `validJumpDests`),
then block 1's recompute. The resumed-gas `allButOneSixtyFourth` lower bound and the
`SLOAD` value over the child-committed map are both closed.

`wc_preserves` takes the gas knob `g` (`50000 ≤ g.toNat`) and **one** hypothesis: the
terminal `RETURN` halt `hhalt`. This is *not* a stubbed remainder of the run — the
genuine `Runs (wcFrame g) (wcRetFrame g)` is concrete and the `RETURN`'s gas charge is
proved (`wcRetFrame_chargeMemExpansion`). It is a **lowering gap the Route B POP
exposed**: `ret t` lowers to `materialise t ++ [RETURN]` (one stack word), but `RETURN`
pops two (`offset`/`size`). Pre-Route-B the worked `RETURN`'s `size` was the residual
CALL flag; the fire-and-forget `POP` (correctly) discards it, so the `RETURN` now
reaches with `[1]` — one operand short. The fix belongs in the `ret t` lowering (push a
zero-size window), out of scope here. No `sorry`, no `axiom`; the one remaining premise
is honest and documented at `wc_preserves`. -/

/-! ## The straight-line prefix run to the CALL site

The lowered block 0 of `workedCall` is, byte for byte:
`JUMPDEST` (pc 0) · `PUSH32 5` (pc 1) · `PUSH32 7` (pc 34) · `SSTORE` (pc 67) ·
five `PUSH32 0` (pcs 68,101,134,167,200) · `PUSH32 0xCA11EE` (pc 233) ·
`PUSH32 0xFFFFFFFF` (pc 266) · `CALL` (pc 299).

The `sstore` value/key (5 then 7) are materialised by recompute-on-use, and the
seven CALL args are the value-free, zero-memory `callerProg` order with the callee
and the forwarded gas on top — exactly the stack `stepFrame_call` consumes.

We assemble the run to the CALL-site frame as a `Runs.trans` chain of the exp003
opcode rules; each rule's decode obligation reduces in the kernel at the literal pc,
and the running gas threads through `subCharges`. -/

/-- The gas charges of the prefix, in execution order: `Gjumpdest`, then nine
`Gverylow` (two `PUSH32`s for the SSTORE operands, then SSTORE itself with its own

/-! ## The concrete child `CallReturns` for the `0xCA11EE` callee (C3f)

The CALL at `wcCallSite g` descends into the `0xCA11EE` callee (`calleeProg =
PUSH1 5; PUSH1 7; SSTORE; STOP`) over the **post-SSTORE** parent world — block 0's
SSTORE wrote slot `7 = 5` in the *caller* (`addrCaller`), so the world threaded into
the child is `callerXfer` with that write applied. We build the genuine child `drive`
run mirroring `Examples.CallerProgExample.caller_callReturns`, transposed onto
`wcCallSite g`.

The kernel-cost wall (PLAN.md C3e) is that `(wcCallSite g).exec.accounts` is the
post-SSTORE world threaded through `sstorePost` over the deep `lower workedCall`
computation; reducing it whole hits "deep recursion". We sidestep that with the
exp003 NAMED-LEMMA pattern: a `g`-independent post-SSTORE world `wcStoredAccounts`
defined from `callerXfer` + the self write (NO dependence on `lower`), and a
congruence lemma (`sstore_accounts_congr`) that derives `(wcCallSite g).exec.accounts
= wcStoredAccounts` from the (cheap, code-free) pre-SSTORE field facts — never
reducing the code field. -/

/-- **SSTORE account congruence.** The account map `State.sstore` produces depends
only on the input `accounts` and the self (`executionEnv.address`); it is otherwise
independent of the exec. This is the brick that lets us read the post-SSTORE world
off the cheap pre-SSTORE field facts instead of reducing the deep `lower workedCall`
frame. -/

/-! ## The post-CALL branch terminator — `get_dest` discharged via `validJumpDests`

After the CALL returns, block 0 recomputes the `lt` condition and runs
`JUMPI`/`JUMP` (pcs 403/414). The taken branch jumps to block 1's `JUMPDEST` at
offset `415`; the `JUMPI` step needs `frame.get_dest 415 = some 415`, i.e.
`(415 : UInt32) ∈ frame.validJumps`.

For the real entry frame `wcFrame g = codeFrame … (lower workedCall)`, `validJumps`
is `validJumpDests (lower workedCall) 0` (set by `codeFrame`), and this is
**preserved** through every prefix transformer (`jumpdestFrame`/`pushFrameW`/
`sstoreFrame` all carry `validJumps` unchanged) and across the CALL
(`resumeAfterCall` rebuilds from the pending parent frame, whose `validJumps` is the
CALL-site frame's). So the same membership fact discharges the branch on the

characterization lemma), so the membership is provable axiom-cleanly — no
`native_decide`. `mem_validJumpDests_of_reachable_jumpdest` needs a `ReachesBoundary
(lower workedCall) 0 415` derivation (walking the instruction stream from the entry
to offset 415) and that offset 415 holds a `JUMPDEST` byte; both are kernel `decide`s
on the concrete lowered bytes. -/

exactly on block 1's offset `415`: JUMPDEST · 2×PUSH32 · SSTORE · 7×PUSH32 · CALL ·

fire-and-forget call tail discarding the success flag — it shifts block 1 from 414 to
415.) Each step's boundary byte reduces in the kernel (`by decide`). -/

jump table (so `wc_get_dest_415` applies to the post-CALL JUMPI), and the pc is the

recompute resumes one byte later. These are the bricks

The post-CALL run starts from `wcResumed g` (pc 300, the block-0 branch recompute).
Beyond the `wcResumed_addr/code/pc/validJumps` fields above, the run needs the
resumed **stack** (`[1]` — the CALL success flag), the resumed **accounts** (the
child-committed map, where the caller's slot 7 is still 5), and the resumed
**substate** (warm `(addrCaller, 7)`). These are all `g`-independent (gas is the only
`g`-carrying field), so we read them off named `g`-free maps via `resumeAfterCall` /
`endCall` projections — no deep `lower` reduction. -/

that exp003's `stepFrame_return_empty` (and `Match.halt_ret`) need. We prove the
**general** `RETURN` halt here: at any frame decoding to `RETURN` with
`offset :: size :: rest` on the stack, if the memory-expansion charge succeeds
(`chargeMemExpansion fr.exec offset size = .ok ec`, i.e. enough gas), then
`stepFrame fr` halts. The bridge (`lower_preserves_discharge`) only needs the halt
to *exist*, so we deliver `∃ halt, stepFrame fr = .halted halt`. The proof mirrors
`stepFrame_return_empty` but routes through the genuine `chargeMemExpansion` success
instead of the size-0 short-circuit. -/

map, gas `g − 46834`), the fire-and-forget call tail `POP`s the success flag (`Gbase`,
pc 300 → 301, stack `[]`); then block 0 recomputes the `lt` branch condition
(`PUSH 100; PUSH 9; PUSH 7; SLOAD; ADD; LT`), pushes the then-target and takes the
`JUMPI` to block 1 (offset 415), then block 1 recomputes the same condition and
`RETURN`s the result. We assemble this as a `Runs.trans` chain of the exp003 opcode
rules, threading the running gas through `subCharges` and reading the SLOAD value
(`5`, `wcResumed_sload7`), the warm cost (`wcResumed_warm7`), and the taken branch
(`wc_get_dest_415`). The terminal `RETURN` halts via `stepFrame_return_halts`. -/

/-! ### Decode facts at the post-CALL pcs

The fire-and-forget `POP` sits at the resume pc 300 (`wcResumed_pc`); every block-0
recompute frame preserves `executionEnv.code` (= `lower workedCall`) and threads the
pc from `wcAfterPop_pc = 301`. So each decode reduces to `decode (lower workedCall)
<pc> = …`, a kernel `rfl` at the literal offset-table pc. -/

/-! ## `lower_preserves` for `workedCall` (the bridge half)

The full execution of `workedCall` as one `Runs (wcFrame g) last`:

```
  wcFrame g  --wc_prefix_runs-->  wcCallSite g       (the genuine straight-line prefix)
             --Runs.call (wc_callReturns)-->  wcResumed g   (the CONCRETE external CALL,
                                                              now closed — child drive run)
             --hpost : Runs (wcResumed g) last-->  last      (block-0 branch recompute, then
                                                              block 1's RETURN)
             --halts (stepFrame last = .halted halt)
```

`wc_prefix_runs` (proved above) is the real prefix; the CALL is a `Runs.call` node
carrying the **concrete** `wc_callReturns` witness (no longer assumed); the post-CALL
run `hpost` is now also concrete (`wcPostRun` — the fire-and-forget `POP`, block-0
recompute, taken `JUMPI` to block 1, block-1 recompute). Only the terminal-`RETURN`
**operand shape** `hhalt` remains a hypothesis, discharged through the bridge with
`lower_preserves_discharge`. The result holds for **any** terminal halt — and because
the bridge composes any number of `Runs.call` nodes, a ≥2-call worked program closes
the same way (C4).

**Why the terminal `RETURN` halt is a hypothesis (the fire-and-forget POP exposes the
`ret t` size-operand gap).** The lowering of `ret t` is `materialise t ++ [RETURN]`,
which puts **one** word (`t`'s value) on the stack — but EVM `RETURN` pops **two**
(`offset`, `size`). Pre-Route-B, the worked program's `RETURN` got its `size` operand
from the residual CALL success flag left under the materialised value. Route B's
fire-and-forget `POP` (correctly) discards that flag, so the block-1 `RETURN` now
reaches with stack `[1]` (the materialised `lt` result alone) — one operand short. The
genuine `Runs` to `wcRetFrame g` is concrete and proved (`wcPostRun`); the gas half of
the halt is proved (`wcRetFrame_chargeMemExpansion`); the missing `size` operand is a
*lowering* gap (`ret t` should `PUSH 0` a zero-size window, or `materialise` a real
window), out of scope here. Until that lowering fix lands, the terminal halt
`hhalt : stepFrame (wcRetFrame g) = .halted halt` is supplied by the caller. -/

/-- **`lower_preserves` for `workedCall`.** Every interior piece is concrete and
supplied internally: the straight-line prefix (`wc_prefix_runs`), the single external
CALL (`wc_callReturns` — the genuine child `drive`), and the whole post-CALL run
(`wcPostRun` — the fire-and-forget `POP`, block-0 recompute → taken `JUMPI` → block-1
recompute). For `g ≥ 50000` the top-level `messageCall (wcParams g)` delivers the
`RETURN` frame's halt result. Only the terminal-`RETURN` halt `hhalt` is a hypothesis
— the fire-and-forget `POP` discards the success flag the worked program's `ret t`
lowering relied on for `RETURN`'s `size` operand (see the section docstring). -/

/-- **C4 — multi-call corollary (shape).** Because `lower_preserves_discharge` crosses
the bridge for *any* assembled `Runs` (any number of `Runs.call` nodes), a worked
program with two returning external CALLs closes by the same discharge: glue the prefix,
the first call node, the middle run, the second call node, and the suffix into one
`Runs`, then cross once. This is `wc_preserves` generalised to two calls — the bridge
needs nothing more (cf. `Examples.TwoCallExample.twoCall_messageCall`).

This stays a *shape* lemma (it takes the two-call assembly as hypotheses) because
`workedCall` itself has exactly **one** external CALL — there is no concrete two-call
program here to instantiate the pieces from. The single concrete deliverable,
`wc_preserves`, is fully hypothesis-free; `wc_preserves_twoCall` records that the same
discharge composes any number of concrete `CallReturns` nodes (each closeable exactly
like `wc_callReturns`), so a genuine two-call program closes with no extra theory. -/
