# LirLean — IR-run **existence** (the `hir` side of the conformance diagram)

`lower_conforms` carries the IR run `IRRun prog o w₀ T O` as a structured hypothesis
(`hir`): the IR side of the diagram, supplied for the program under study. This module
discharges that hypothesis **constructively** for the call-free fragment as far as
totality is tractable — banking the pieces of the "construct `hir`" milestone
(`docs/lower-conforms-plan.md`, missing scaffolding: *`RunFrom` determinism/totality*).

`RunFrom.det` (`Law.lean`) already gives the *uniqueness* half. This module gives the
**existence** half, bottom-up, mirroring the determinism ladder:

* `EvalStmt` existence — a **gas-free, non-call** statement whose operands are bound steps
  to a definite post-state (`evalStmt_exists`). Gas-free because `assign t .gas` *consumes*
  a trace read, so its existence is gated on the trace being non-empty (a separate, trace-
  threading concern); non-call because `Stmt.call` consults the oracle (handled by the
  call layer). Within that fragment the step is total — it never gets stuck.
* `RunStmts` existence — a **gas-free, call-free** statement list, each statement
  definable at its running state, runs to a definite post-state with the trace unchanged
  (`runStmts_exists`). By induction on the list, threading the post-state.
* `RunFrom`/`IRRun` existence (single halt block) — a program whose **entry block is a halt**
  (`stop` / `ret`), gas-free and call-free, with the `ret` operand bound at the post-statement
  state, has an IR run (`irRun_exists_stop` / `irRun_exists_ret`). The single-block DAG base case
  of the CFG-totality argument: no edges, so no CFG-acyclicity measure is needed.
* `RunFrom`/`IRRun` existence (**general acyclic CFG**) — `runFrom_exists`/`irRun_exists`
  generalise the above to any acyclic call-free gas-free program via a **block topological rank**
  (`CFGAcyclic`, a *control-flow* measure distinct from `Acyclic.lean`'s *def-graph* rank): by
  strong induction on the rank, halts bottom out and `jump`/`branch` recurse at the
  strictly-smaller-rank successor. The state-threaded definability supply is `RunDefinable`. This
  discharges the general `hir` for the call-free/gas-free fragment.

This is the **honest tractable floor** of `hir` construction. What remains (gas-read trace supply
coupling `hir` to the recording) is described in the module-end note.

Frame-free: imports only `LirLean.Law` (hence `Machine`/`IR`/`Evm`) — no `BytecodeLayer`,
no `Frame`, no `Runs`. No `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`.

/-! ## `EvalStmt` existence for the gas-free, non-call fragment

A statement is in the *gas-free, non-call* fragment when it is an `assign t e` with
`e ≠ .gas`, or an `sstore key value`. For such a statement, `EvalStmt` fires to a definite
post-state with the trace **unchanged** (only `assign t .gas` consumes a read), provided the
operands are bound:

* `assign t e` (`e ≠ .gas`): needs `evalExpr st 0 e` defined (`assignPure`);
* `sstore key value`: needs both `key` and `value` bound (`sstore`).

We phrase the operand-definedness as `StmtDefinable st s` and produce the witness post-state. -/

/-- **Operand-definedness of a gas-free, non-call statement at state `st`.** The minimal
side-condition for `EvalStmt` to fire to a definite post-state without consuming a trace read:
an `assign t e` (`e ≠ .gas`) needs `e` to evaluate; an `sstore key value` needs both operands
bound. `assign t .gas` and `call` are out of this fragment (they are `False` here). -/
def StmtDefinable (st : IRState) : Stmt → Prop
  | .assign _ e => e ≠ .gas ∧ ∃ w, evalExpr st 0 e = some w
  | .sstore key value => (∃ kw, st.locals key = some kw) ∧ (∃ vw, st.locals value = some vw)
  | .call _ => False
  | .create _ => False

/-- The post-state a gas-free, non-call definable statement steps to: `assign` binds the
evaluated value; `sstore` writes the cell. (A total function on the fragment; the `call`
case is unreachable under `StmtDefinable` and pinned to `st`.) -/

  | .sstore key value =>
      st.setStorage (st.locals key |>.getD 0) (st.locals value |>.getD 0)
  | .call _ => st
  | .create _ => st

/-- **`EvalStmt` existence (gas-free, non-call fragment).** A `StmtDefinable` statement
steps to `stmtPost st s` with the trace unchanged. The trace `T` is arbitrary and preserved:
no read is consumed (the only consuming statement, `assign t .gas`, is excluded by
`StmtDefinable`). -/

/-! ## `RunStmts` existence for the gas-free, call-free fragment

Threading `stmtPost` through a statement list. The definability of each statement is at its
*running* state, so we phrase it as a fold: `StmtsDefinable st ss` says the head is definable
at `st` and the tail is definable at the head's post-state. The witness final state is the
left fold of `stmtPost`. -/

the state reached by running the prefix before it. The fold companion of `StmtDefinable`. -/

/-- **`RunStmts` existence (gas-free, call-free fragment).** A `StmtsDefinable` statement list
runs to `stmtsPost st ss` with the trace unchanged. By induction on the list; each head fires
via `evalStmt_exists`, the tail by the IH at the head's post-state. -/

/-! ## Run-definability: the state-threaded definability supply

The cyclic drive walk (`DriveSim.lean`) runs each block's statements then continues at the
successor with the threaded post-statement state. To fire it needs, at each block reached, the
operand-definedness of the statement fold *plus* the branch condition bound at the post-statement
state. We
supply this for **every** state (a sound over-approximation of "every reachable state"): the
existence claim is then state-uniform, exactly matching how the former `StmtTies`/`TermTies`
(since reshaped into the run-DERIVED `StmtTies'`/`TermTies'` in `Realisability/RealisabilitySpec.lean`)
were quantified over all `(L, b)`.

`RunDefinable prog` bundles, for every present block:
* `stmts` — the block's statements are `StmtsDefinable` from any state (the §2 fold);
* `ret_def` — a `ret t` block's operand is bound at the post-statement state;
* `branch_def` — a `branch cond _ _` block's condition is bound at the post-statement state.

`jump`/`stop` need nothing beyond `stmts` (the jump's successor definability is the IH; `stop`
halts). The post-statement state is `stmtsPost st b.stmts`, threaded from the caller's `st`. -/

/-- **`RunDefinable prog`** — the state-uniform definability supply that lets `RunFrom` fire at
every present block: statements `StmtsDefinable` from any state, plus the halt/branch operands
bound at the post-statement state. Quantified over all states (a sound over-approximation of the
reachable ones), matching the all-`(L,b)` quantification of the §7 ties. Consumed by the cyclic
drive simulation (`DriveSim.lean`). -/

  /-- Every present block's statements are `StmtsDefinable` from any starting state. -/
