# LirLean — decode round-trip checks (C2 acceptance bar)

This module is the **executable, build-enforced** evidence that `lower` produces
`Evm.decode`-compatible bytecode for the full single-call IR surface. It defines a
worked single-call program `workedCall` exercising every C2 construct —

* storage arithmetic: `sload`, `sstore`, `add`, `lt`;
* exactly one external `Stmt.call` (value-free, calldata-free — the `callerProg`
  shape);
* `Term.branch` (and `Term.ret` / `Term.stop`);

— and then asserts, with `example … := by rfl`, that `Evm.decode (lower workedCall)
pc = expected` at **every** emitted instruction pc. Because these are `example`s
(not `#eval`s), a regression in `lower` that breaks decode-compatibility breaks the
build. No `sorry`, no `axiom`.

See `docs/ir-design.md` §4 ("Decode-compatibility — the acceptance bar").

/-! ## Block JUMPDEST offsets (the offset table is a concrete prefix sum)

Block 0 starts at 0, block 1 at 414, block 2 at 518. These are exactly the
immediates the `branch`/`jump` destination pushes must carry, checked below. -/

example : offsetTable (defsOf workedCall) (recomputeFuel workedCall) workedCall.blocks 0 = 0 := by rfl
example : offsetTable (defsOf workedCall) (recomputeFuel workedCall) workedCall.blocks 1 = 414 := by rfl
example : offsetTable (defsOf workedCall) (recomputeFuel workedCall) workedCall.blocks 2 = 518 := by rfl
example : code.size = 520 := by rfl

/-! ## Decode round-trip at every emitted pc

Each `example` pins one instruction. The constructors `decode` returns confirm the
exp003 form: `ADD = .ArithLogic .ADD`, `LT = .ArithLogic .LT`, `SLOAD/SSTORE/GAS/
JUMP/JUMPI/JUMPDEST = .Smsf …`, `STOP/RETURN/CALL = .System …`, pushes carry the
big-endian immediate and width. -/

example : decode code 0   = some (.Smsf .JUMPDEST, none)             := by rfl
example : decode code 1   = some (.Push .PUSH32, some (5, 32))       := by rfl   -- value 5 (for sstore)

/-! ### Block 0 — the `branch` condition recompute, then JUMPI/JUMP

`branch (t 6) …` re-materialises `t 6 = (sload 7 + 9) < 100`. Materialisation is
operands-then-op with the second operand pushed first, so the literal order is:
PUSH32 100 (the `lt`'s right operand `t5`), then PUSH32 9 (`add`'s right operand
`t3`), then PUSH32 7 (`sload`'s key `t1`), then SLOAD, ADD, LT — then
`PUSH4 thenOff; JUMPI; PUSH4 elseOff; JUMP`. -/

example : decode code 300 = some (.Push .PUSH32, some (100, 32))     := by rfl   -- lt operand (t5)
example : decode code 333 = some (.Push .PUSH32, some (9, 32))       := by rfl   -- add operand (t3)
example : decode code 366 = some (.Push .PUSH32, some (7, 32))       := by rfl   -- sload key (t1)

example : decode code 415 = some (.Push .PUSH32, some (100, 32))     := by rfl  -- lt operand (t5)
example : decode code 448 = some (.Push .PUSH32, some (9, 32))       := by rfl  -- add operand (t3)
example : decode code 481 = some (.Push .PUSH32, some (7, 32))       := by rfl  -- sload key (t1)

/-! ### Block 2 — JUMPDEST, STOP -/

example : decode code 518 = some (.Smsf .JUMPDEST, none)             := by rfl
example : decode code 519 = some (.System .STOP, none)               := by rfl

/-! ## The branch destinations are legal jump targets

The two branch-destination immediates (414, 518) decode to `JUMPDEST` — proven
axiom-cleanly by the `decode code 402 = PUSH4 414`, `decode code 408 = PUSH4 518`
checks above together with `decode code 414 = JUMPDEST` and
`decode code 518 = JUMPDEST`. So the lowered `JUMPI`/`JUMP` land on real
`JUMPDEST`s — a prerequisite for exp003's jump steps. (We do not assert
`validJumpDests` directly: it is a `partial def`, so the only way to evaluate it in
a proof is `native_decide`, which would pull in a native-reduction axiom and break
the axiom-clean bar. The four `rfl` decode checks give the same guarantee for the
two destinations this program actually uses.) -/
