# LirLean — recorder lemmas (extracted from `Spec/Recorder.lean`)

The proof companions of the recording interpreter (`LirLean/Spec/Recorder.lean`,
the former `RunLog.lean`): the SLOAD/CALL value-level bridges
(`sloadRecord_eq_sloadCost` / `realisedCall_cons`) and the adequacy chain
(`driveLog_drive` → `runWithLog_drive` → `runWithLog_messageCall`). Extracted so
`Spec/Recorder.lean` stays a definitions-only spec-core file (Wave 3,
`docs/fleet-2026-07-02/reorg-legibility.md` §5 Step 3); the former direct importers
of `LirLean.RunLog` (`SimTerm.lean`, `Drive/SelfPresent.lean`) import this
module instead, so every downstream consumer reaches the lemmas exactly as before.

-- RELOCATED from `Spec/Recorder.lean` (originally `Oracle.lean`): the two defs the §7
-- tie-discharge layer (`Drive/SelfPresent.lean` — `GasLogAligned`,
-- `FramesRun.snoc`/`.snoc_seed`, `gasRecord_eq_gasReadOf`, `gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs`)
-- still consumes. Recorder-proof machinery, not spec-core, so it lives here rather than in
-- the trusted `Spec/` cone. The rest of the gas-law interface (`GasRealises`,
-- `.monotoneGas`, the guard theorems) was deleted with the gas-monotonicity law
-- (docs/gas-decision.md).

/-- The `Word` a `GAS` opcode at (post-charge) frame `fr` reports: `ofUInt64` of the
frame's `gasAvailable`. The realisability bridge between a gas read and a frame. -/
def gasReadOf (fr : Frame) : Word := UInt256.ofUInt64 fr.exec.gasAvailable

/-- The GAS-frames are threaded by `Runs` in program order: each is reachable from the
previous (so the machine genuinely ran between the two reads). A `Runs`-chain over the
witness list. -/
def FramesRun : List Frame → Prop
  | [] => True
  | [_] => True
  | a :: b :: rest => Runs a b ∧ FramesRun (b :: rest)

/-- **The SLOAD value-level bridge** (parallel to `gasReadOf_gasFrame_eq_obs`). At an
SLOAD frame `g` whose stack-head is the bound key (`g.exec.stack.head? = some key`), the
recorded warmth-charge `sloadWarmthOf g` is exactly the value `SloadRealises` demands at
that frame: `sloadCost (accessedStorageKeys.contains (self, key))`. `simp`-clean (it is
`sloadWarmthOf`'s `some`-branch unfolded). So once the (deferred) alignment selects that
the SLOAD cursor's recorded charge is this site's `sloadWarmthOf`, the `sloadChg k =
sloadCost …` conjunct of `SloadRealises` is discharged at the cursor frame. -/

/-- **`realisedCall` faithfulness (head/cons projection).** When the log recorded a CALL
(`log.calls = rec :: tl`), the realised call stream is `evmV2CallEntry` at that record's
`(result, pending)` — the `resumeAfterCall` projection of `LirLean/CallRealises.lean` —
CONSED onto the stream of the remaining records. `rfl`-clean, so `callRealises_bridge` ties
this head's `(world', success)` entry to the lowered CALL's observable by construction (the
call-side realisability), positionally per record. -/

/-! ## Result adequacy: `driveLog` agrees with `drive`

`driveLog` mirrors `drive` branch-for-branch, so its result projection is exactly
`drive`'s result — the recording does not change *what* the machine computes, only
*what it remembers*. By induction on fuel, each branch reducing both sides one step
to a recursive call the IH closes (the recording splices are erased by `.map (·.1)`). -/

/-- **Result adequacy of `driveLog`.** The recording interpreter computes the same
result as `drive`: erasing the log (`Except.map (·.1)`) recovers `drive`'s output,
for *any* accumulator. Induction on fuel, one branch per `drive`/`driveLog`
transition — the two are definitionally the same control flow, the splices only
touch the (erased) accumulator. -/

/-! ## Adequacy: `runWithLog` agrees with the verified semantics (`drive`/`messageCall`)

The recording interpreter's `observable` is exactly the value the **verified** engine
computes. Lifting `driveLog_drive` (result adequacy of the parallel recorder) through
`runWithLog`'s entry: a successful `runWithLog params fuel` pins both `drive fuel`'s and
`messageCall`'s output (the latter at the same fuel — `runWithLog` takes the fuel
explicitly rather than `seedFuel`; the two coincide once `fuel = seedFuel params.gas`,
see `runWithLog_messageCall`). This is the `Type`-interpreter↔relation bridge the
lessons doc calls *adequacy* — extract from the function, reason with the relation. -/

/-- **Adequacy of `runWithLog` against `drive`.** A successful recording run pins
`drive`'s result to the recorded `observable`: the recording does not change *what* the
verified engine computes. Directly from `driveLog_drive`. -/

/-- **`realisedCreate` faithfulness (head/cons projection)** — the CREATE twin of
`realisedCall_cons`. When the log recorded a CREATE (`log.creates = rec :: tl`), the realised
create stream is `evmV2CreateEntry` at that record CONSED onto the stream of the remaining
records. `rfl`-clean (`simp … List.map_cons`), so `createRealises_bridge` ties this head's
`(world', addr)` entry to the lowered CREATE's observable by construction. -/
