# LirLean — `sim_cfg` (Layer **F**: whole-CFG world-channel simulation)

The capstone of the **world-channel** simulation grind (general over calls): it threads the
per-block bricks of Layers C–E into a whole-CFG simulation `sim_cfg` (:983), by induction on
`V2.RunFrom`, abstracted over the per-block `SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep` ties.

This file's payoff is `sim_cfg`. The tie from `sim_cfg` to the instrumented recording interpreter
`runWithLog` — the actual conformance headline — is **NOT** here: the local `lower_conforms` that
once closed that tie was deleted in the vacuous-ties purge (b144af8). The LIVE flagship is
`lower_conforms` at `V2/Realisability/RealisabilitySpec.lean:206` (R11); see the §-block at the
bottom of this file.

## The two structured per-block hypotheses

The induction is on `V2.RunFrom`, the IR CFG driver. Each constructor runs a block's
statement list and then its terminator. The statement-list simulation is Layer D
(`sim_stmts_block`); the terminator simulation is Layer E (`sim_term_halt_*` /
`sim_term_edge_*`). Rather than re-thread Layers D and E's *enormous* per-block structured
hypothesis bundles (decode coverage at every static cursor, gas/stack envelopes, the
SSTORE/SLOAD/GAS realisability ties, the jump-destination round-trips) through the CFG
induction — they are per-block and per-intermediate-frame, so they cannot be stated once up
front — we abstract them into **two** structured hypotheses at exactly the altitude of the
Layer-D / Layer-E conclusions:

* `SimStmtStep prog sloadChg obs L b` (Layer D, `SimStmts.lean`) — the per-statement
  simulation, already the unit Layer D consumes.
* `SimTermStep prog sloadChg obs self L b` (Layer E, here) — the per-terminator
  simulation: from `Corr` at the terminator cursor and the block's `RunStmts`-post IR state,
  either **halt** with a frame whose `observe` *world* matches the IR halt's world (the `stop`
  / `ret` arms, E1), or **run to the taken successor's entry** re-establishing `Corr` at
  `(succ, 0)` (the `jump` / `branch` arms, E2).

`SimTermStep` is the exact union of E1's and E2's conclusions, dispatched on `b.term` and the
IR run's terminator facts. Discharging it for a concrete program is a mechanical case split on
`b.term` feeding `sim_term_halt_stop` / `sim_term_halt_ret` / `sim_term_edge_jump` /
`sim_term_edge_branch` their structured-hypothesis bundles (the A1–A3 decode anchors, the E3
jump-validity, the gas envelopes) — exactly as `SimStmtStep` is discharged for the statement
arms. This is the **realisability contract**: `sim_cfg` runs the IR under the streams the
lowered bytecode realises, and carries the per-block realisability as `SimStmtStep` /
`SimTermStep` (the `docs/ir-design-v3.md` §7 supplied-observation model).

## Scope — all statements, world channel

Layer D now ranges over **all** statements: Route B's `sim_call_stmt` consumes the lowered
CALL's success flag (`MSTORE` to the result slot, or `POP`), re-establishing `stack = []`, so a
`Stmt.call` no longer breaks the induction — `sim_cfg` carries no call-free side
condition. The channel is the **world** (storage) component: `observe`'s `result`
is the value-free `.stopped` boundary (the RETURN value channel is the tracked deferral,
`Spec/Recorder.lean` `observe` doc). `sim_cfg`'s conclusion asserts the world component of
`observe self (endFrame last halt)`.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`. Bytecode-coupled (imports the Layer-E bricks);
nothing here touches `Spec/Semantics.lean` / `V2/Law.lean` (the frame-free spine).

/-! ## The per-terminator simulation hypothesis `SimTermStep`

`SimTermStep prog sloadChg obs self L b` packages Layer E's call-free conclusion uniformly
over the four IR terminators, matching `V2.RunFrom`'s constructor shape. It is what the CFG
induction consumes after Layer D has run the block's statements to the terminator cursor.

Two productions, exactly E1's and E2's conclusions:

* **halt** (`stop` / `ret`) — given `Corr` at the terminator cursor and the matching IR halt
  observable `Oend`, produce a halting frame `last` whose `observe` *world* is `Oend.world`;
* **edge** (`jump` / `branch`) — given `Corr` at the terminator cursor and the IR's chosen
  successor `succ`, run to `succ`'s entry frame re-establishing `Corr` at `(succ, 0)`.

The dispatch is on `b.term` together with the IR-side terminator witnesses (`hterm`, and for
the edges the resolved successor), so a concrete discharge case-splits `b.term` and feeds the
four Layer-E lemmas. Quantified over the post-`RunStmts` IR state `st'` and the terminator
frame `frT` (the frame Layer D delivers at the terminator cursor). -/

/-- **The per-terminator simulation step** (Layer E, call-free, abstracted over the block).
For block `b` at label `L`, a frame `frT` in `Corr`-correspondence with the post-statement IR
state `st'` at the terminator cursor `(L, b.stmts.length)`:

* if `b.term` is a **halt** (`stop` or `ret t`), there is a halting frame `last` reached from
  `frT` whose `observe self` **world** is the IR halt's world (`st'.world` for `stop`;
  `st'.world` for `ret`, the value-free world channel);
* if `b.term` is an **edge** (`jump dst`, or `branch` taking `succ`), there is a frame `fr'`
  reached from `frT` re-establishing `Corr` at the taken successor's entry `(succ, 0)`.

The halt case carries the IR halt observable `O` so the world equation is stated against the
same `O` the `RunFrom` halt constructor produces; the edge case carries the IR-resolved
successor `succ` so the re-established `Corr` is at the block the `RunFrom` recursion enters. -/

/-! ## `WellFormedLowered` — the structural side-conditions, folded

The per-shape `_lowered` wrappers (`sim_sstore_stmt_lowered`, `sim_term_halt_ret_lowered`,
`sim_term_edge_jump_lowered`, `sim_term_edge_branch_lowered`) carry one kind of *structural*
(non-runtime) side-condition that depends only on the **program text**, not on the trace:
the **program-size pc/offset bounds** — every static cursor / block offset fits a 32-bit pc
(`< 2^32`). These are pure facts about `offsetTable` / `termOf` / `pcOf` and the size of
`lower prog` (there is NO fuel-sufficiency obligation: the fold emission `matCache` always
fully expands, structural termination on the ordered def-env).

`WellFormedLowered prog` folds exactly those structural side-conditions, quantified over every
present block and (for the statement bounds) every cursor. The builders below pull the relevant
field per shape, so the structural residual leaves the builder hypotheses entirely — only the
*genuine* runtime recording-correspondence ties (`SstoreRealises` / `hret` / gas envelopes — the
§7 supplied-observation contract) stay explicit. The `validJumps`-recording ties are no longer
among them: they are discharged structurally from `Corr` (`Corr.validJumps_lower`). -/

/-- **The folded structural well-formedness predicate** (fuel-free, over the fold emission).
Bundles, over every present block of `prog`, the program-size pc/offset bounds (`< 2^32`) the
`_lowered` wrappers carry — each operand's byte length is its fold-cache length
`(matCache prog ·).length`, the cursors are `pcOf`/`termOf`, and the block offsets read
`offsetTable (matCache prog) (defsOf prog)`. Purely structural — a function of the program
text, independent of the run; a finite check on the lowered program size, derived from
`codeFits` (`Spec/BudgetDerivations.lean`). -/

  source syntax cannot choose spill slots. This is `sim_call_stmt`'s `hslots`: it pins the
  result slot of the binding MSTORE and the 32-aligned disjointness of distinct bound slots. (Slot
  *addressability* — `slotOf t + 63 < 2^64` — is a property of the realised frame's memory,
  so it travels with the `CallRealises` tie / `IRWellFormed.slotAddr`, not here.) -/

/-! ## Discharging `SimStmtStep` / `SimTermStep` for the call-free fragment

`SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep` are the per-block realisability bundles `sim_cfg` consumes.
Discharging them for a concrete program is a case split on the statement / terminator
shape feeding the Layer-C/E lemmas (`sim_assign` / `sim_sstore_stmt` ; `sim_term_*`).
Those lemmas in turn carry their *own* honest structured hypotheses — the per-byte
`MatDecC` decode coverage at the runtime cursors, the immediate round-trips, the gas/stack
envelopes, and the genuine SLOAD/SSTORE/GAS realisability ties (the §7
supplied-observation contract). The two builders below carry exactly that residual,
minimised to the per-(cursor/frame) ties, so `sim_cfg` and its callers see a thin
realisability surface rather than the opaque `SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep` props.

### The `assign`-arm discharge (fully closed down to the genuine ties)

A **rematerialised** `assign` needs *no* decode bundle — `emitStmt … (.assign _ _) = []`
when the target is not spilled, so the lowered segment is `Runs.refl` and `sim_assign`
consumes only the per-step scoping (`StepScoped`) and the post-state realisability ties. A
**spilled gas** `assign t .gas` (Phase B) emits the `[GAS] ++ PUSH ++ MSTORE` stash and is
discharged by `sim_assign_gas` (the gas value lands in `slotOf t`, tied by `MemRealises`).
Both arms are folded into the general `simStmtStep_block` below; the old assign-only
specialisation is retired (superseded, and it baked in the now-false "every assign emits
nothing"). The `sstore` arm additionally needs the `MatDecC` decode coverage over
the fold byte caches at the runtime cursors, and so is carried whole. -/

/-! ### The `call`-arm discharge (the §7 CALL tie)

For a `.call cs` cursor, `simStmtStep_call` feeds `sim_call_stmt` (`SimStmt.lean` Arm 3,
Route B). The CALL is a *genuine runtime call observation*: the realised external CALL trace
(`CallReturns`, the resume frame, the realised-oracle pinning, the arg-push run reaching the
CALL site, and the Route-B tail) cannot be discharged from the program text — it is the
analogue of `SstoreRealises`/the gas-SLOAD ties (the `docs/ir-design-v3.md` §7 supplied
observation). `CallRealises` bundles exactly that supply, quantified over the cursor frame;
the structural side-conditions (slot registration + addressability) come from
`WellFormedLowered`, and the pre-call `MemRealises` comes from `Corr.memAgree`.

The realised step is pinned via the post-state `st0' = evmV2CallEntry result pd self`-effect (in
the walk, the consumed call-stream head at this cursor IS that recorded entry, `realisedCall_cons`
— `rfl`-clean per record), so the `EvalStmt` call step's post-state *is* the realised effect
`sim_call_stmt` consumes. Positional: distinct dynamic calls pin distinct heads, so no single-call
restriction. -/

/-- **The §7 CALL realisability tie.** For a `.call cs` cursor with frame `fr0` in `Corr`
correspondence and IR post-state `st0'`, `CallRealises` supplies the realised external-CALL trace
`sim_call_stmt` consumes: the recorded `(result, pd)` and self address, the realised post-state
pin `st0' = evmV2CallEntry result pd self`-effect (so the call step's post-state is the realised
one), the arg-push run reaching the CALL-site frame `callFr` with its pc/memory pins, the
returning CALL (`CallReturns callFr resumeFr`) with the resume-frame pins, the post-state
realisability ties, and the Route-B tail's realisability. The genuine runtime call observation
(the analogue of `SstoreRealises`), supplied per cursor and quantified over the corresponding
frame. -/

/-! ### The combined statement discharge

`simStmtStep_block` case-splits a general block's statements per shape into the
`assign` / `sstore` / `call` arms — so `SimStmtStep` is CONSTRUCTIBLE for any create-free
block, given `WellFormedLowered` and the per-shape genuine ties (including the §7 `CallRealises`

condition `hnocreate` (the create-reflection is Step 5, `docs/create/BUILD-PLAN.md`). -/

/-! ### The `branch`-terminator discharge (decode-free via `sim_term_edge_branch_lowered`)

For a `Term.branch cond thenL elseL`, `SimTermStep`'s `halt` arm is vacuous. The `edge` arm's
two branch disjuncts (`cw ≠ 0 → succ = thenL`, `cw = 0 → succ = elseL`) route through
`sim_term_edge_branch_lowered`, whose strengthened cw-tied conclusion pins the resolved
successor to the runtime condition — so the `succ` `SimTermStep` asks for is exactly the one the
lowered branch lands on. The decode bundle and the `validJumps`-recording tie (via
`Corr.validJumps_lower` + `MatRunsC.validJumps`) are discharged inside; `WellFormedLowered`
supplies the structural pc/offset bounds. The genuine residual is the cond-materialise run
(`MatRunsC`) and the gas envelopes (§7), plus the successor blocks' presence. -/

/-- **`SimTermStep` for a `branch`-terminator block.** If `b.term = .branch cond thenL elseL`
with both successors present, then — given `WellFormedLowered` and, at every terminator-cursor
frame, the genuine control-flow ties (the cond-materialise `MatRunsC`, the gas envelopes) —
`SimTermStep` holds. The cw-tied conclusion of `sim_term_edge_branch_lowered` reconciles the
`SimTermStep.edge` disjunct's chosen `succ` with the runtime-resolved branch. -/

/-! ## `sim_cfg` — the whole-CFG simulation

Induction on `V2.RunFrom`. Each constructor:

* runs the block's statement list (any statements, incl. calls) via Layer D
  (`sim_stmts_block`), from `Corr` at the block entry `(L, 0)` to `Corr` at the terminator
  cursor `(L, b.stmts.length)` with the working stack back to `[]`;
* then dispatches on the terminator: `stop`/`ret` halt via `SimTermStep.halt` (the world
  matches `st'.world`, which is the IR halt's world); `jump`/`branch` run to the successor's
  entry via `SimTermStep.edge`, re-establishing `Corr`, and the **IH** closes the recursion.

`RunFrom` is an inductive `Prop`, so the structural recursion on the derivation is well-founded
— no fuel. The per-block simulation is supplied uniformly as the two `∀`-quantified structured
hypotheses (`SimStmtStep` already ranges over calls, via `sim_call_stmt`). -/

/-- **`sim_cfg` — whole-program CFG simulation (general over calls, world channel).** From
`Corr` at the entry cursor `(L, 0)` and a `V2.RunFrom prog o st T L O`, where every block
reached supplies the per-statement (`SimStmtStep`) and per-terminator (`SimTermStep`)
simulations, the lowered bytecode runs from `fr` to a halting frame `last` whose `observe self`
**world** is the IR observable `O`'s world.

Induction on the `RunFrom` derivation: Layer D runs each block's statements; `SimTermStep`
either halts (matching the world, the `stop`/`ret` base cases) or steps to the taken
successor's entry where the IH applies (the `jump`/`branch` recursion). -/

/-! ## `entry_corr` — the entry correspondence builder (the leading-JUMPDEST step)

`sim_cfg` is seeded at `Corr prog … { locals := fun _ => none, world := w₀ } fr₀ prog.entry 0`
— `Corr` at the *entry block's body cursor* `(prog.entry, 0)`, whose pc is
`pcOf prog prog.entry 0 = offsetTable … prog.entry.idx + 1`: one byte *past* the entry block's
leading `JUMPDEST`. The top-level entry frame `fr₀ = codeFrame p (lower prog)`, however, sits at
pc `0` — *on* that `JUMPDEST` (when the entry block is block 0, `offsetTable … 0 = 0`). So the
entry `Corr` is reached by the single leading-`JUMPDEST` step, exactly as a `jump`/`branch` edge
lands on a successor block's `JUMPDEST` and steps it (`corr_at_jumpdest_landing`).

`entry_corr` discharges the former `hentry` hypothesis from:

* the entry block being block `0` (`prog.entry.idx = 0`, so its `JUMPDEST` is at byte 0 = the
  codeFrame's pc) and present (`blockAt prog prog.entry = some bentry`);
* the *genuine* entry-frame realisability tie — `StorageAgree` between `w₀` and the entry
  frame's storage lens (the IR initial world *is* the accounts the run uses). (There is NO
  entry-frame gas/sload universal anymore: both are spilled, their values live in memory slots
  tied by `MemRealises` at the def-sites — Phase B/C.)
* the `Gjumpdest` gas margin.

The structural `Corr` clauses (code / pc / stack / canModifyState) are read off `codeFrame`
mechanically; `DefsSound`/`wellScoped` are vacuous at the empty-locals entry state
(`defsSound_entry`). -/

/-- **The entry frame field reductions.** `codeFrame p (lower prog)` runs `lower prog` at pc 0
with an empty stack, the modifiable flag of `p`, gas `p.gas`, validJumps `validJumpDests (lower
prog) 0`, and a `.call`-kind. (All `rfl` off the `codeFrame`/`codeEnv` definitions.) -/

/-! ### Discharging the entry STORAGE tie definitionally

`entry_corr`'s `hstore : StorageAgree { …, world := w₀ } (codeFrame p (lower prog))` ties the
IR initial world `w₀` to the entry frame's self-storage lens. In `lower_conforms` (and the
since-deleted `lower_conforms_acyclic`) the world `w₀` is **universally quantified** (a free choice), so this
tie is not a runtime fact — it is *definitional*: choosing `w₀ := selfStorage (codeFrame …)`
makes `StorageAgree` hold by `rfl`. The lemma below records that canonical choice, banking the
`hstore` entry tie (the only entry-frame tie not intrinsic to the recording — `hsload`/`hgasr`
constrain *every* same-address frame's warmth/gas, the supplied-observation correspondence,
and so stay genuine). -/

/-- **`entry_corr` — the entry correspondence.** For an entry block `bentry` that is block `0`
(`prog.entry.idx = 0`) and present, the top-level entry frame `codeFrame p (lower prog)` —
running `lower prog` from pc 0 with empty stack, `p` modifiable — steps its leading `JUMPDEST`
(`runs_jumpdest`) to a frame in `Corr`-correspondence with the empty-locals entry state at
`(prog.entry, 0)`. The genuine ties (`StorageAgree` at the entry frame, and the
`Gjumpdest` margin) are the entry-frame realisability contract; `DefsSound` / `wellScoped` are
vacuous at empty locals. (The gas value channel is now `MemRealises` at the gas def-sites, not
an entry-frame universal — Phase B.) -/

/-! ## The recorder tie lives at the flagship, not here

This file once closed a local `lower_conforms` that tied `sim_cfg` to the instrumented recording
interpreter `runWithLog` and claimed the world equation was "**fully discharged** here". That
theorem was **deleted in the vacuous-ties purge (b144af8)**: the per-block simulation hypotheses
it consumed (`hstmts`/`hterm`) were unsatisfiable in the shape supplied for a lowered program, so
it discharged nothing.

**This file no longer contains a discharged headline.** Its payoff is `sim_cfg` (:983) — the
whole-CFG world-channel simulation, abstracted over the per-block `SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep`
ties. The LIVE conformance headline — the tie from a successful `runWithLog` to the IR `RunFrom`
and the load-bearing world equation — is the flagship `lower_conforms` at
`V2/Realisability/RealisabilitySpec.lean:206` (R11). Its remaining obligation is the coupled
run-producer documented there (Route A); consult that file for the honest hypothesis ledger. -/
