# LirLean — `sim_cfg` + `lower_conforms` (Layer **F** of the general `lower_conforms` grind)

The capstone of the **world-channel** `lower_conforms` grind (general over calls). It threads the
per-block bricks of Layers C–E into a whole-CFG simulation (`sim_cfg`, by induction on
`V2.RunFrom`) and then ties that to the instrumented recording interpreter `runWithLog`
(`lower_conforms`).

## The two structured per-block hypotheses

The induction is on `V2.RunFrom`, the IR CFG driver. Each constructor runs a block's
statement list and then its terminator. The statement-list simulation is Layer D
(`sim_stmts_block`); the terminator simulation is Layer E (`sim_term_halt_*` /
`sim_term_edge_*`). Rather than re-thread Layers D and E's *enormous* per-block structured
hypothesis bundles (decode coverage at every static cursor, gas/stack envelopes, the
SSTORE/SLOAD/GAS realisability ties, the jump-destination round-trips) through the CFG
induction — they are per-block and per-intermediate-frame, so they cannot be stated once up
front — we abstract them into **two** structured hypotheses at exactly the altitude of the
Layer-D / Layer-E conclusions:

* `SimStmtStep prog sloadChg obs o L b` (Layer D, `SimStmts.lean`) — the per-statement
  simulation, already the unit Layer D consumes.
* `SimTermStep prog sloadChg obs o self L b` (Layer E, here) — the per-terminator
  simulation: from `Corr` at the terminator cursor and the block's `RunStmts`-post IR state,
  either **halt** with a frame whose `observe` *world* matches the IR halt's world (the `stop`
  / `ret` arms, E1), or **run to the taken successor's entry** re-establishing `Corr` at
  `(succ, 0)` (the `jump` / `branch` arms, E2).

`SimTermStep` is the exact union of E1's and E2's conclusions, dispatched on `b.term` and the
IR run's terminator facts. Discharging it for a concrete program is a mechanical case split on
`b.term` feeding `sim_term_halt_stop` / `sim_term_halt_ret` / `sim_term_edge_jump` /
`sim_term_edge_branch` their structured-hypothesis bundles (the A1–A3 decode anchors, the E3
jump-validity, the gas envelopes) — exactly as `SimStmtStep` is discharged for the statement
arms. This is the **realisability contract**: `sim_cfg` runs the IR under the oracles the
lowered bytecode realises, and carries the per-block realisability as `SimStmtStep` /
`SimTermStep` (the `docs/ir-design-v3.md` §7 supplied-observation model).

## Scope — all statements, world channel

Layer D now ranges over **all** statements: Route B's `sim_call_stmt` consumes the lowered
CALL's success flag (`MSTORE` to the result slot, or `POP`), re-establishing `stack = []`, so a
`Stmt.call` no longer breaks the induction — `lower_conforms` carries no call-free side
condition. The channel is the **world** (storage) component: `observe`'s `result`
is the value-free `.stopped` boundary (the RETURN value channel is the tracked deferral,
`V2/RunLog.lean` `observe` doc). `sim_cfg`'s conclusion asserts the world component of
`observe self (endFrame last halt)`.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`. Bytecode-coupled (imports the Layer-E bricks);
nothing here touches `V2/Machine.lean` / `V2/Law.lean` (the frame-free spine).

/-! ## The per-terminator simulation hypothesis `SimTermStep`

`SimTermStep prog sloadChg obs o self L b` packages Layer E's call-free conclusion uniformly
over the four IR terminators, matching `V2.RunFrom`'s constructor shape. It is what the CFG
induction consumes after Layer D has run the block's statements to the terminator cursor.

Two productions, exactly E1's and E2's conclusions:

* **halt** (`stop` / `ret`) — given `Corr` at the terminator cursor and the matching IR halt
  observable `Oend`, produce a halting frame `last` whose `observe` *world* is `Oend.world`;
* **edge** (`jump` / `branch`) — given `Corr` at the terminator cursor and the IR's chosen
  successor `succ`, run to `succ`'s entry frame re-establishing `Corr` at `(succ, 0)`.

The dispatch is on `b.term` together with the IR-side terminator witnesses (`hterm`, and for
the edges the resolved successor), so a concrete discharge case-splits `b.term` and feeds the
four Layer-E lemmas. Quantified over the post-`RunStmts` IR state `st'` and the terminator
frame `frT` (the frame Layer D delivers at the terminator cursor). -/

/-- **The per-terminator simulation step** (Layer E, call-free, abstracted over the block).
For block `b` at label `L`, a frame `frT` in `Corr`-correspondence with the post-statement IR
state `st'` at the terminator cursor `(L, b.stmts.length)`:

* if `b.term` is a **halt** (`stop` or `ret t`), there is a halting frame `last` reached from
  `frT` whose `observe self` **world** is the IR halt's world (`st'.world` for `stop`;
  `st'.world` for `ret`, the value-free world channel);
* if `b.term` is an **edge** (`jump dst`, or `branch` taking `succ`), there is a frame `fr'`
  reached from `frT` re-establishing `Corr` at the taken successor's entry `(succ, 0)`.

The halt case carries the IR halt observable `O` so the world equation is stated against the
same `O` the `RunFrom` halt constructor produces; the edge case carries the IR-resolved
successor `succ` so the re-established `Corr` is at the block the `RunFrom` recursion enters. -/

/-! ## `WellFormedLowered` — the structural side-conditions, folded

The per-shape `_lowered` wrappers (`sim_sstore_stmt_lowered`, `sim_term_halt_ret_lowered`,
`sim_term_edge_jump_lowered`, `sim_term_edge_branch_lowered`) carry two kinds of *structural*
(non-runtime) side-condition that depend only on the **program text**, not on the trace:

* **recompute-fuel sufficiency** — `MatFueled (defsOf prog) (recomputeFuel prog) e` for every
  expression `e` the block materialises (the `sstore` operands, the `ret` operand). This is the
  honest well-formedness tie: `recomputeFuel` exceeds the def-chain depth of every materialised
  tmp. It is **discharged structurally** from a rank-based SSA acyclicity witness in
  `Acyclic.lean` (`wellFormedLowered_of_acyclic`), so an acyclic program carries no `MatFueled`
  hypothesis (`lower_conforms_acyclic`);
* **program-size pc/offset bounds** — every static cursor / block offset fits a 32-bit pc
  (`< 2^32`). These are pure facts about `offsetTable` / `termOf` / `pcOf` and the size of
  `lower prog`.

`WellFormedLowered prog` folds exactly those structural side-conditions, quantified over every
present block and (for the statement bounds) every cursor. The builders below pull the relevant
field per shape, so the structural residual leaves the builder hypotheses entirely — only the
*genuine* runtime recording-correspondence ties (`SstoreRealises` / `hret` / gas envelopes — the
§7 supplied-observation contract) stay explicit. The `validJumps`-recording ties are no longer
among them: they are discharged structurally from `Corr` (`Corr.validJumps_lower`). -/

/-- **The folded structural well-formedness predicate.** Bundles, over every present block of
`prog`, the recompute-fuel sufficiency of each materialised operand (`MatFueled`) and the
program-size pc/offset bounds (`< 2^32`) the `_lowered` wrappers carry. Purely structural — a
function of the program text, independent of the run. The `MatFueled` fields are discharged from
acyclicity (`Acyclic.lean`); the bounds are a finite check on the lowered program size. -/

  carries the lowering-only `.slot` marker (a `WellFormed` invariant, vacuous for real
  IR — no source program writes a `.slot` expression). This is `sim_call_stmt`'s
  `hslots`: it pins the result slot of the binding MSTORE and the 32-aligned disjointness of
  distinct bound call-result slots. (Call-result slot *addressability* — `slotOf t + 63 < 2^64`
  — is a property of the realised resume frame's memory, so it travels with the `CallRealises`
  tie, not here.) -/

/-! ## Discharging `SimStmtStep` / `SimTermStep` for the call-free fragment

`SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep` are the per-block realisability bundles `sim_cfg` consumes.
Discharging them for a concrete program is a case split on the statement / terminator
shape feeding the Layer-C/E lemmas (`sim_assign` / `sim_sstore_stmt` ; `sim_term_*`).
Those lemmas in turn carry their *own* honest structured hypotheses — the per-byte
`MatDec` decode coverage at the runtime cursors, the immediate round-trips, the gas/stack
envelopes, and the genuine SLOAD/SSTORE/GAS realisability ties (the §7
supplied-observation contract). The two builders below carry exactly that residual,
minimised to the per-(cursor/frame) ties, so `sim_cfg`/`lower_conforms` see a thin
realisability surface rather than the opaque `SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep` props.

### The `assign`-arm discharge (fully closed down to the genuine ties)

A **rematerialised** `assign` needs *no* decode bundle — `emitStmt … (.assign _ _) = []`
when the target is not spilled, so the lowered segment is `Runs.refl` and `sim_assign`
consumes only the per-step scoping (`StepScoped`) and the post-state realisability ties. A
**spilled gas** `assign t .gas` (Phase B) emits the `[GAS] ++ PUSH ++ MSTORE` stash and is
discharged by `sim_assign_gas` (the gas value lands in `slotOf t`, tied by `MemRealises`).
Both arms are folded into the general `simStmtStep_block` below; the old assign-only
specialisation is retired (superseded, and it baked in the now-false "every assign emits
nothing"). The `sstore` arm additionally needs the `MatDec` decode coverage over
`materialiseExpr` at the runtime cursors, and so is carried whole. -/

/-! ### The `sstore`-arm discharge (decode-free via `sim_sstore_stmt_lowered`)

For an `sstore`-only call-free block, every statement routes through `sim_sstore_stmt_lowered`
— the decode bundle (the operand `MatDec`s + the consuming `SSTORE`) is already discharged
generically over `lower prog` inside the wrapper. The structural side-conditions (`MatFueled`
×2 + the pc bound) are pulled from `WellFormedLowered`; the only residual is the genuine runtime
SSTORE recording-correspondence tie (`SstoreRealises` + the non-zero-value `hnz`, the §7
supplied-observation contract at the internal SSTORE frame). -/

/-- **`SimStmtStep` for an `sstore`-only call-free block.** If every statement of `b` is an
`Stmt.sstore`, then — given `WellFormedLowered` (the structural fuel/pc side-conditions) and,
at every cursor, the genuine runtime SSTORE ties (gas/stack envelopes, `SstoreRealises`, and the
non-zero written value) — `SimStmtStep` holds. The decode is discharged inside
`sim_sstore_stmt_lowered`. -/

/-! ### The `call`-arm discharge (the §7 CALL tie)

For a `.call cs` cursor, `simStmtStep_call` feeds `sim_call_stmt` (`SimStmt.lean` Arm 3,
Route B). The CALL is a *genuine runtime call observation*: the realised external CALL trace
(`CallReturns`, the resume frame, the realised-oracle pinning, the arg-push run reaching the
CALL site, and the Route-B tail) cannot be discharged from the program text — it is the
analogue of `SstoreRealises`/the gas-SLOAD ties (the `docs/ir-design-v3.md` §7 supplied
observation). `CallRealises` bundles exactly that supply, quantified over the cursor frame;
the structural side-conditions (slot registration + addressability) come from
`WellFormedLowered`, and the pre-call `MemRealises` comes from `Corr.memAgree`.

The realised step is pinned via `o = evmV2CallOracle result pd self` (in the headline,
`o = realisedCall log self` *is* that realised oracle, `realisedCall_eq_evmV2` — `rfl`-clean
when the log recorded the CALL), so the abstract `EvalStmt prog o` call step *is* the realised
step `sim_call_stmt` consumes. -/

/-- **The §7 CALL realisability tie.** For a `.call cs` cursor with frame `fr0` in `Corr`
correspondence, `CallRealises` supplies the realised external-CALL trace `sim_call_stmt`
consumes: the recorded `(result, pd)` and self address, the realised-oracle identification
`o = evmV2CallOracle result pd self` (so the abstract call step is the realised step), the
arg-push run reaching the CALL-site frame `callFr` with its pc/memory pins, the returning CALL
(`CallReturns callFr resumeFr`) with the resume-frame pins, the post-state realisability ties,
and the Route-B tail's realisability. The genuine runtime call observation (the analogue of
`SstoreRealises`), supplied per cursor and quantified over the corresponding frame. -/

/-! ### The combined statement discharge

`simStmtStep_block` case-splits a general block's statements per shape into the
`assign` / `sstore` / `call` arms — so `SimStmtStep` is CONSTRUCTIBLE for *any* block, given
`WellFormedLowered` and the per-shape genuine ties (including the §7 `CallRealises` tie for the
call arm). The three arms are exhaustive over `EvalStmt`. -/

/-- **`SimStmtStep` for any block (general over calls).** Dispatches each statement on its
shape: `assign` via `sim_assign` (no decode), `sstore` via `sim_sstore_stmt_lowered` (decode
discharged inside), `call` via `simStmtStep_call` (`sim_call_stmt` + the §7 `CallRealises`
tie). `WellFormedLowered` supplies the structural fuel/pc/slot side-conditions; the per-shape
genuine runtime ties (assign post-state realisability; sstore gas/`SstoreRealises`/non-zero;
the realised CALL trace) are the explicit §7 hypotheses. The three arms are exhaustive over
`EvalStmt`, so NO call-free side condition is needed. -/

vacuous (its `b.term = jump/branch` hypotheses are unsatisfiable) and the `halt` arm's `ret`
disjunct is too. The remaining `stop` halt routes through `sim_term_halt_stop`, whose `STOP`
decode is itself discharged from A3 (`decode_at_term_nonpush`) + the terminator-cursor pc
bridge (`pcOf_eq_termOf`): the only residual is the genuine top-level-frame facts — the self
address (`hself`), the `.call`-kind (`hkind`), and the non-empty committed accounts (`hne`) —
exactly the `EntersAsCode`/successful-run facts the §7 contract supplies. A complete
`SimTermStep` discharge for the `stop` terminator. -/

RETURN-site tie (`hself`, the returned-value binding `st'.locals t = some vw`, the gas/stack

For a `Term.branch cond thenL elseL`, `SimTermStep`'s `halt` arm is vacuous. The `edge` arm's
two branch disjuncts (`cw ≠ 0 → succ = thenL`, `cw = 0 → succ = elseL`) route through
`sim_term_edge_branch_lowered`, whose strengthened cw-tied conclusion pins the resolved
successor to the runtime condition — so the `succ` `SimTermStep` asks for is exactly the one the
lowered branch lands on. The decode bundle and the `validJumps`-recording tie (via
`Corr.validJumps_lower` + `MatRuns.validJumps`) are discharged inside; `WellFormedLowered`
supplies the structural pc/offset bounds. The genuine residual is the cond-materialise run
(`MatRuns`) and the gas envelopes (§7), plus the successor blocks' presence. -/

`SimTermStep` holds. The cw-tied conclusion of `sim_term_edge_branch_lowered` reconciles the

/-! ## `sim_cfg` — the whole-CFG simulation

Induction on `V2.RunFrom`. Each constructor:

* runs the block's statement list (any statements, incl. calls) via Layer D
  (`sim_stmts_block`), from `Corr` at the block entry `(L, 0)` to `Corr` at the terminator
  cursor `(L, b.stmts.length)` with the working stack back to `[]`;
* then dispatches on the terminator: `stop`/`ret` halt via `SimTermStep.halt` (the world
  matches `st'.world`, which is the IR halt's world); `jump`/`branch` run to the successor's
  entry via `SimTermStep.edge`, re-establishing `Corr`, and the **IH** closes the recursion.

`RunFrom` is an inductive `Prop`, so the structural recursion on the derivation is well-founded
— no fuel. The per-block simulation is supplied uniformly as the two `∀`-quantified structured
hypotheses (`SimStmtStep` already ranges over calls, via `sim_call_stmt`). -/

/-- **`sim_cfg` — whole-program CFG simulation (general over calls, world channel).** From
`Corr` at the entry cursor `(L, 0)` and a `V2.RunFrom prog o st T L O`, where every block
reached supplies the per-statement (`SimStmtStep`) and per-terminator (`SimTermStep`)
simulations, the lowered bytecode runs from `fr` to a halting frame `last` whose `observe self`
**world** is the IR observable `O`'s world.

Induction on the `RunFrom` derivation: Layer D runs each block's statements; `SimTermStep`
either halts (matching the world, the `stop`/`ret` base cases) or steps to the taken
successor's entry where the IH applies (the `jump`/`branch` recursion). -/

/-! ## `paramsFor` — the canonical top-level params running `lower prog`

`paramsFor prog accounts gas` is the `CallParams` that runs `lower prog` as a top-level code
call over `accounts` at gas `gas`, with the self/caller/origin pinned to `selfAddr` (the
storage lens `observe`/`Corr` read). It is the generic analogue of `WorkedCall.wcParams`, with
the program and the world (as the `accounts` map carrying the self account's storage) free.
`lower_conforms` is stated over an *abstract* `p : CallParams` with `EntersAsCode p fr₀`; the
canonical instantiation is `p := paramsFor …`, whose `EntersAsCode` is `paramsFor_entersAsCode`
(`beginCall_code`, the entry frame is `codeFrame (paramsFor …) (lower prog)`). The IR world
`w₀` is the self account's storage lens through `selfStorage`/`storageAt` (the `StorageAgree`
clause of the carried entry `Corr`), so it is determined by `accounts` rather than threaded
separately. -/

/-! ## `entry_corr` — the entry correspondence builder (the leading-JUMPDEST step)

`sim_cfg` is seeded at `Corr prog … { locals := fun _ => none, world := w₀ } fr₀ prog.entry 0`
— `Corr` at the *entry block's body cursor* `(prog.entry, 0)`, whose pc is
`pcOf prog prog.entry 0 = offsetTable … prog.entry.idx + 1`: one byte *past* the entry block's
leading `JUMPDEST`. The top-level entry frame `fr₀ = codeFrame p (lower prog)`, however, sits at
pc `0` — *on* that `JUMPDEST` (when the entry block is block 0, `offsetTable … 0 = 0`). So the
entry `Corr` is reached by the single leading-`JUMPDEST` step, exactly as a `jump`/`branch` edge
lands on a successor block's `JUMPDEST` and steps it (`corr_at_jumpdest_landing`).

`entry_corr` discharges the former `hentry` hypothesis from:

* the entry block being block `0` (`prog.entry.idx = 0`, so its `JUMPDEST` is at byte 0 = the
  codeFrame's pc) and present (`blockAt prog prog.entry = some bentry`);
* the *genuine* entry-frame realisability tie — `StorageAgree` between `w₀` and the entry
  frame's storage lens (the IR initial world *is* the accounts the run uses). (There is NO
  entry-frame gas/sload universal anymore: both are spilled, their values live in memory slots
  tied by `MemRealises` at the def-sites — Phase B/C.)
* the `Gjumpdest` gas margin.

The structural `Corr` clauses (code / pc / stack / canModifyState) are read off `codeFrame`
mechanically; `DefsSound`/`wellScoped` are vacuous at the empty-locals entry state
(`defsSound_entry`). -/

/-- **The entry frame field reductions.** `codeFrame p (lower prog)` runs `lower prog` at pc 0
with an empty stack, the modifiable flag of `p`, gas `p.gas`, validJumps `validJumpDests (lower
prog) 0`, and a `.call`-kind. (All `rfl` off the `codeFrame`/`codeEnv` definitions.) -/

/-! ### Discharging the entry STORAGE tie definitionally

`entry_corr`'s `hstore : StorageAgree { …, world := w₀ } (codeFrame p (lower prog))` ties the
IR initial world `w₀` to the entry frame's self-storage lens. In `lower_conforms`/
`lower_conforms_acyclic` the world `w₀` is **universally quantified** (a free choice), so this
tie is not a runtime fact — it is *definitional*: choosing `w₀ := selfStorage (codeFrame …)`
makes `StorageAgree` hold by `rfl`. The lemma below records that canonical choice, banking the
`hstore` entry tie (the only entry-frame tie not intrinsic to the recording — `hsload`/`hgasr`
constrain *every* same-address frame's warmth/gas, the supplied-observation correspondence,
and so stay genuine). -/

/-- **The entry STORAGE tie, definitionally.** Taking the IR initial world to be the entry
frame's own self-storage lens (`selfStorage (codeFrame p code)`) discharges `StorageAgree` by
reflexivity. The canonical `w₀` choice for the entry-frame storage tie. -/

/-- **`entry_corr` — the entry correspondence.** For an entry block `bentry` that is block `0`
(`prog.entry.idx = 0`) and present, the top-level entry frame `codeFrame p (lower prog)` —
running `lower prog` from pc 0 with empty stack, `p` modifiable — steps its leading `JUMPDEST`
(`runs_jumpdest`) to a frame in `Corr`-correspondence with the empty-locals entry state at
`(prog.entry, 0)`. The genuine ties (`StorageAgree` at the entry frame, and the
`Gjumpdest` margin) are the entry-frame realisability contract; `DefsSound` / `wellScoped` are
vacuous at empty locals. (The gas value channel is now `MemRealises` at the gas def-sites, not
an entry-frame universal — Phase B.) -/

/-! ## `lower_conforms` — tying `sim_cfg` to the recording interpreter

The headline. From a successful `runWithLog` over the lowered program, recover:

1. **the IR run** — `IRRun prog (realisedGas log) (realisedCall log self) w₀ O` for *some*
   observable `O`. We do **not** synthesise the `RunFrom` derivation from the bytecode
   (`runWithLog` records the *bytecode* trace, not the IR one); instead we carry the IR run as
   a structured hypothesis (`hir`) — the **IR side** of the conformance diagram, supplied for
   the program under study and itself the subject of the IR-determinism / supplied-observation
   contract (`docs/ir-design-v3.md` §7). This is the honest realisability hypothesis: the IR
   run *under the realised oracles* the bytecode produces.
2. **the world equation** — `O.world = (observe self log.observable).world`. This is the
   load-bearing conformance edge, and it is **fully discharged** here from `sim_cfg`:
   `runWithLog_messageCall` pins `messageCall = .ok log.observable.toCallResult`; `sim_cfg` +
   `messageCall_runs` pins `messageCall = .ok (toCallResult (endFrame last haltSig))`; equating
   the two `toCallResult`s (`observe` reads only `.toCallResult`) gives `observe self
   log.observable = observe self (endFrame last haltSig)`, whose world is `O.world` by
   `sim_cfg` and `IRRun.det`.

The former entry `Corr` hypothesis is now **discharged** in-proof by `entry_corr` (the
leading-`JUMPDEST` step from the top-level frame), so `lower_conforms` no longer carries it:
its replacements are the structural entry facts (`hentry0`/`hbentry`/`hbound` — the entry block
is block 0, present, pc-bounded) plus the *genuine* entry-frame realisability ties
(`hstore`/`hsload`/`hgasr`/`hgasj`). The per-block simulations (`hstmts`/`hterm`) and the IR
run (`hir`) remain the carried structured hypotheses — the supplied-observation realisability
contract (`hstmts`/`hterm` are themselves now dischargeable per shape by `simStmtStep_block`
/ `simTermStep_block`, down to the per-cursor genuine ties — including the §7 `CallRealises`
tie for `.call` — and the per-shape decode bundles). `runWithLog` at the seed fuel makes the
`messageCall` bridge exact. There is **no** call-free side condition: the call statement is
folded into the spine via `sim_call_stmt` (Route B). -/

/-- **`lower_conforms` (general over calls, world channel — under the realisability contract).**
For a program `prog`, initial world `w₀`, self address `self`, observable IR run `O` and run log
`log`: if the recording run `runWithLog p (seedFuel p.gas)` over the top-level params `p`
(canonically `paramsFor prog self accounts gas`) succeeds with `log`, where `p` is a top-level
`.Code (lower prog)` modifiable call (`hp`/`hmod`), the entry block is block 0 and present
(`hentry0`/`hbentry`/`hbound`), the genuine entry-frame realisability ties hold
(`hstore`/`hsload`/`hgasr`/`hgasj`), the per-block simulations (`hstmts`/`hterm`) hold, and the
IR runs under the realised oracles to `O` (`hir`), then **the IR observable's world equals the
`observe` world of the recorded bytecode result**:

  `O.world = (observe self log.observable).world`.

The world edge is fully discharged from `sim_cfg` + the `messageCall` bridge + `IRRun.det`; the
IR run itself and the per-block realisability are the carried hypotheses (the §7
supplied-observation contract). -/

`SimStmtStep`/`SimTermStep` props. With the builders (`simStmtStep_block`/`simTermStep_block`)
those props are now CONSTRUCTIBLE from `WellFormedLowered` (the folded structural side-conditions)
plus the genuine §7 recording-correspondence ties. `lower_conforms_wf` re-states the headline at
that altitude: its hypotheses reduce to

* **well-formedness** — `WellFormedLowered prog` (`MatFueled` + pc/offset bounds + the
  call-result slot registration);
* **the genuine §7 ties** — the per-block statement (`StmtTies`) and terminator (`TermTies`)
  recording-correspondence bundles (collected/named below), and the entry-frame ties;
* **the IR run** — `hir`.

It delegates to `lower_conforms`, building `hstmts`/`hterm` through the combined builders. -/

/-- **`lower_conforms_wf` — the builder-based world-channel compiler-correctness headline.**
For a program `prog` (general over calls) whose lowering is well-formed (`WellFormedLowered`),
if the recording run over the top-level `.Code (lower prog)` call
succeeds (`hwl`/`hp`/`hmod`), the entry block is block 0 / present / pc-bounded
(`hentry0`/`hbentry`/`hbound`), the genuine entry-frame ties hold (`hstore`/`hsload`/`hgasr`/
`hgasj`), the genuine per-block statement (`hstmtties`) and terminator (`htermties`) §7 ties hold,
and the IR runs under the realised oracles to `O` (`hir`), then **the IR observable's world equals
the `observe` world of the recorded bytecode result**:

  `O.world = (observe self log.observable).world`.

The per-block simulations are built from `WellFormedLowered` + the §7 ties via
