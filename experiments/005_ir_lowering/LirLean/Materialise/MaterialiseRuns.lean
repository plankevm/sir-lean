# LirLean — materialisation value-channel adapters

This module retains the IR-indexed materialisation side conditions:

* `evalExpr_obs_irrel` for the pure expression fragment;
* `StorageAgree` for the IR-state storage lens;
* `MemRealises` for the IR temporary-to-memory channel;
* the legacy `SloadRealises` and `GasRealises` predicates still reached by the
  current correspondence proofs.

The EVM-only frame, stash, and memory facts are re-exported for these adapters.

/-! ## `evalExpr` obs-irrelevance on the pure fragment

`Lir.evalExpr` reads its `obs` argument **only** in the `.gas` arm. So for any
non-`gas` expression the supplied gas value is irrelevant — this is what lets B1's
`.tmp t` recursion bridge `DefsSound`'s `evalExpr st 0 e'` to the `obs`-threaded value
the rest of the induction carries. -/

/-! ## The realisability side-conditions (storage lens; the retired SLOAD/GAS universals)

**Phase B/C**: gas AND sload are now **spilled** — a bare `Expr.gas` / `Expr.sload _` is never
materialised (uses go through `.slot`/MLOAD; the def-site stash is run by `sim_assign_gas` /
`sim_assign_sload`). So the `.gas` and `.sload` arms of `materialise_runsC` are **unreachable**,
discharged by `e ≠ .gas` and `∀ k, e ≠ .sload k` (both preserved across the `.tmp` recursion by
`defsOf_ne_gas`/`defsOf_ne_sload`). The two former realisability universals are retired:

* **`SloadRealises`** (RETIRED, Phase C) — the old `∀ g`-universal forcing `sloadChg k` to equal
  the runtime `sloadCost` warmth at every same-address frame. Unsatisfiable on any cold-then-warm
  same-key re-read (2100 ≠ 100). No longer carried: the SLOAD value lives in the slot (tied by
  `MemRealises`), and the warmth cost is the single cold/warm def-site read (the positional
  `SloadLogAligned` selection). Survives only as the `Drive/SelfPresent.lean` regression witness
  (`sloadRealises_charge_of_witness`); the `HonestGasTie.lean` unsatisfiability witness is deleted
  (lesson in `RealisabilitySpec.lean`'s header + `docs/gas-decision.md`).

* **`GasRealises`** (RETIRED, Phase B) — the analogous `∀ g`-gas-value universal; same story.

* **`StorageAgree`** — the still-live `M3` storage correspondence `selfStorage fr key = st.world
  key`. Preserved across the whole materialisation by `MatRunsC.storage` (every post-frame leaves
  the self account's storage *values* untouched), threading as a plain per-frame fact. It ties the
  storage lens to `evalExpr`'s world read (consumed by the `sstore` value/key materialise calls). -/

/-- The OLD B2 SLOAD-cost resolver realisability universal: at every frame `g` sharing `fr`'s
self-address, `sloadChg k` is the actual `sloadCost` warmth-charge for the bound key
`st.locals k`.

**RETIRED FROM THE CONFORMANCE SPINE (Phase C).** This `∀ g`-universal is unsatisfiable for any
genuine ≥2-read run of the same key: after the first cold→warm access `accessedStorageKeys.contains`
flips, so the warmth-charge for the *same* key changes (2100 → 100), and the universal forces the
single resolver value `sloadChg k` to equal *both* charges — it cannot hold. It is **no longer
carried by `Corr`/`materialise_runsC`/the headlines**: sload is spilled to memory, so the SLOAD
value lives in the slot (tied by `MemRealises`, the honest positional one-read value supplied at
the `assign` def-site by `sim_assign_sload`), and the warmth charge is the single cold/warm read at
that def-site (the positional `SloadLogAligned` selection via `sloadRealises_charge_of_witness`, not
this universal). This def survives ONLY as the subject of the positional discharge
`Drive/SelfPresent.lean` (`sloadRealises_charge_of_witness`); its unsatisfiability witness
(`sloadRealises_universal_unsatisfiable`) is deleted with `HonestGasTie.lean` (lesson in
`RealisabilitySpec.lean`'s header + `docs/gas-decision.md`). The honest replacement is the positional
SLOAD twin `SloadLogAligned` (`Drive/SelfPresent.lean`), satisfiable by a real cold-then-warm run. -/
def SloadRealises (sloadChg : Tmp → ℕ) (st : Lir.IRState) (fr : Frame) : Prop :=
  ∀ (g : Frame) (k : Tmp) (key : Word),
    g.exec.executionEnv.address = fr.exec.executionEnv.address →
    st.locals k = some key →
    sloadChg k
      = Evm.sloadCost (g.exec.substate.accessedStorageKeys.contains
          (g.exec.executionEnv.address, key))

/-- The OLD `GAS` value realisability universal: at every frame `g` sharing `fr`'s self-address,
the supplied gas word `obs` is `ofUInt64` of the post-`Gbase` gas `g` reports.

**RETIRED FROM THE CONFORMANCE SPINE (Phase B).** This `∀ g`-universal is unsatisfiable for any
genuine ≥2-distinct-read run (a real EVM run's gas strictly descends, so two same-address GAS reads
report two distinct words, and the universal forces `obs` to equal both). It is **no longer carried
by `Corr`/`materialise_runsC`/the headlines**: gas is spilled to memory, so its value lives in the
slot and is tied by `MemRealises` (the honest positional one-read value supplied at the `assign`
def-site, `sim_assign_gas`). This def survives ONLY as the subject of the positional discharge
`Drive/SelfPresent.lean` (`gasRealises_obs_of_witness`); its unsatisfiability witness
(`gasRealises_universal_unsatisfiable`) is deleted with `HonestGasTie.lean` (lesson in
`RealisabilitySpec.lean`'s header + `docs/gas-decision.md`). The honest replacement is the positional
`GasLogAligned` (`Drive/SelfPresent.lean`), satisfiable by a real descending-gas run. -/
def GasRealises (obs : Word) (fr : Frame) : Prop :=
  ∀ (g : Frame),
    g.exec.executionEnv.address = fr.exec.executionEnv.address →
    obs = UInt256.ofUInt64 (g.exec.gasAvailable - UInt64.ofNat Gbase)

/-- The `M3` storage correspondence: the self account's stored value at `key` (through
the observable lens) equals the IR world. Threaded as a plain per-frame fact —
preserved across the materialisation by `MatRunsC.storage`. -/
def StorageAgree (st : Lir.IRState) (fr : Frame) : Prop :=
  ∀ key, selfStorage fr key = st.world key

/-! ### Transport of the storage side-condition across a sub-frame

`StorageAgree` transports through the self-storage equality `MatRunsC.storage` provides — the
clause the `add`/`lt`/`sstore` recursion needs to pass the storage tie to its second/inner
operand. (The `SloadRealises`/`GasRealises` `.transport` lemmas are retired with their
universals: gas and sload are spilled, so neither is carried by `Corr`/`materialise_runsC`
anymore — Phase B/C.) -/

theorem StorageAgree.transport {st : Lir.IRState} {fr fr' : Frame}
    (h : StorageAgree st fr)
    (hstor : ∀ k, selfStorage fr' k = selfStorage fr k) :
    StorageAgree st fr' :=
  fun key => by rw [hstor key]; exact h key

/-! ## The memory value-channel realisability — `MemRealises`

The memory analogue of `SloadRealises`/`GasRealises`/`StorageAgree`: the bytecode's memory
**realises** the IR's bound call-result locals. For every call-result tmp `t` (registered as
`.slot slot` in `defsOf`) that the IR currently holds a value `v` for, the running frame
carries, at byte offset `slot`:

* **coverage** — `slot + 32 ≤ memory.size` (the 32-byte window is allocated),
  `slot + 32 ≤ activeWords.toNat * 32` (the window is active, i.e. within the
  memory-expansion frontier), and `slot + 63 < 2 ^ 64` (a realistic, non-truncating
  memory offset — `slotOf t = t.id * 32` always is); and
* **value** — `(…mload slot).1 = v` (the readback returns the bound flag).

Coverage travels *with* the value because `MLOAD` is not a pure read — it grows `activeWords`
(memory expansion), which can retroactively un-zero an *uncovered* read. A bound call-result
slot is always covered (the binding MSTORE allocated its bytes and grew `activeWords` over it),
so the coverage is honest and the value survives the materialise sub-runs (`MemRealises.transport`).

The active clause is stated as `slot + 32 ≤ activeWords.toNat * 32` (rather than the weaker
`slot < activeWords.toNat * 32`): for a 32-aligned slot this is exactly "MLOAD at `slot` does
*not* expand memory" (`memoryExpansionWords? activeWords slot 32 = some activeWords`), which is
what pins the readback's gas charge to the abstract two-step MLOAD charge
— the memory analogue of `SloadRealises` resolving the SLOAD warmth cost. -/
def MemRealises (prog : Program) (st : Lir.IRState) (fr : Frame) : Prop :=
  ∀ t slot v, defsOf prog t = some (.slot slot) → st.locals t = some v →
    (UInt256.ofNat slot).toNat + 32 ≤ fr.exec.toMachineState.memory.size
    ∧ (UInt256.ofNat slot).toNat + 32 ≤ fr.exec.toMachineState.activeWords.toNat * 32
    ∧ slot + 63 < 2 ^ 64
    ∧ (fr.exec.toMachineState.mload (UInt256.ofNat slot)).1 = v


/-- **Transport of `MemRealises` across a materialise sub-run.** Given the memory `bytes`
unchanged (`MatRunsC.memBytes`) and `activeWords` nondecreasing (`MatRunsC.memActive`),
`MemRealises` carries from `fr` to `fr'`: equal bytes ⇒ equal `.size` ⇒ in-bounds preserved;
nondecreasing `activeWords` ⇒ active preserved; covered + equal bytes ⇒ the readback value is
preserved (`mload_covered_congr`). -/
