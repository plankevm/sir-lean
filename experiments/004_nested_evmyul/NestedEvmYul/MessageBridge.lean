# T4 — `MessageBridge`: the general X-to-`runΘ` bridge
# (flat `messageCall_runs` analog) + the derived fuel envelope

Closes parity-verdict gap #2 (docs/planning/exp004-parity-verdict-2026-07-19.md
§4): a general, reusable bridge from the `X`-level reasoning layer to the
top-level fuel-free `runΘ` over an ARBITRARY `NestedWorld` seeding — the
endgame's inline steps (2)–(4) (ObservableTriple.lean:352–396) hoisted into one
theorem — plus direct bounded-offset variants and a fragment where the bound is
**derived from gas**, not assumed. The keystone-backed `ΘRuns.runΘ_complete'`
offers a separate depth-capped route with no numeric offset condition.

## The shape, against flat

Flat's bridge (EVM/BytecodeLayer/Spec.lean:70, `messageCall_runs`):
`EntersAsCode p fr₀` + `Runs fr₀ last` + halt ⟹ `messageCall p = .ok …`,
with **no numeric side condition**. That unconditionality rests on two flat
facts: `drive` fuel-monotonicity is TRUE and never-OOF is unconditional.
Nested `Θ` fuel-monotonicity was refuted while the CREATE/CREATE2 catch-all
absorbed an inner `Lambda` `OutOfFuel`; after the 2026-07-20 propagation patch,
`FuelMono.res_mono` proves it. This file's original bridge statements retain
their direct bounded-offset route, while `ΘRuns.runΘ_complete'` supplies the
depth-capped unbounded alternative:

* `ΘRuns_of_X_family` — the **veneer** conclusion needs NO envelope (pure
  cofinal introduction): the side condition is entirely a property of the
  *adequacy* step (pinning the seeded `runΘ`), not of the layer crossing.
* `runΘ_of_X_family` — the **driver** conclusion carries `m + 4 ≤ seedFuel w`
  and therefore needs no depth premise.

## The risky half: deriving the envelope ("gas pays for fuel")

For **call-free straight-line chains** the envelope is DERIVED, not assumed:
every gas-witnessed chain link (`IterStepG` — an `IterStepU` whose opcode is
runnable and outside the CREATE/CALL family, witnessed at the top level) burns
`≥ 1` gas (`Z`'s two ℕ-guards + `gas_EVM_step_default` + `C'_pos_of_runnable`),
so a length-`n` chain forces `n ≤ w.g.toNat`, and `seedFuel`'s one guaranteed
copy of `(g + fuelHops)` (`fuelBound_ge`) absorbs `n + 4` outright. Headline:
`completedWith_of_gasDerived` — a top-level observable conclusion with **no
numeric fuel hypothesis at all** (only the structural `w.e ≤ 1024` depth cap).

## Obstruction record: why the derivation stops at the call-free fragment

The general per-link decrement (`IterStepU → gas strictly drops`) and the
general envelope derivation both FAIL, for reasons worth pinning precisely:

* **(A) CREATE links still block the per-link decrement (statement-level).**
  A CREATE/CREATE2 link CAN still inhabit `IterStepU`: its `∀`-fuel `step`
  clause pins ONE successor at every fuel, which excludes any fuel-*sensitive*
  inner `Lambda` — since the 2026-07-20 vendored patch an inner `Λ`
  `OutOfFuel` now propagates as `.error .OutOfFuel` (an eternally-failing
  create no longer silently iterates), but a create whose `Λ` fails for a
  fuel-*independent* reason still yields the same `.ok` step result at every
  fuel: `Lambda` itself absorbs non-`OutOfFuel` `Ξ` errors into a `z = false`
  result (Semantics.lean, the `Ξ`-error arm of `Lambda`), and the
  nonce-overflow/guard-else branches are fuel-blind. Proving even those links
  debit `≥ 1` requires crossing the arm's gas reconstitution
  `.ofNat (a − L a + g′.toNat)`, whose wrap-safety needs `g′ ≤ L a` — child
  gas *conservation*, i.e. a `Lambda`-level gas-mono induction. So the
  per-link lemma is NOT independent of the descent machinery, and `IterStepG`
  carries `¬ isCallCreate` as a premise instead of deriving it. (This is also
  the one spot where UInt256 wraparound re-enters: `Z`'s own guards compare in
  ℕ via `toNat` *before* subtracting, so the chain lemma is wrap-safe; the
  CREATE arm's `gasAvailable + g′` UInt256 addition is guarded only AFTER the
  addition.)
* **(B) CALL-family links are refutable but not worth refuting.** `call 0 =
  .error .OutOfFuel` propagates honestly through the CALL arms' do-bind, so
  the `f = 0` instance of a `∀`-fuel step clause can never be `.ok` — a
  CALL-family `IterStepU` link is uninhabited. Discharging that inside the
  gas lemma would cost a CALL-arm unfolding sweep for a case real programs
  never enter through this door: call sites enter as `X_call_iter`'s cofinal
  families, not as chain links.
* **(C) Call OFFSETS are the irreducible residue.** In a composed family the
  offset is `m = n₁ + n₂ + k₁ + k₂ + c`: gas pays for the chain lengths `nᵢ`
  (derived here), but the `kᵢ` are the CHILDREN's fuel budgets. Fuel ≠ gas
  across a descent: the child must fund its own loop AND per-depth hop
  overhead, summing to exactly `fuelBound`'s PRODUCT `(1025 − e)·(g +
  fuelHops)`. A linear-in-gas premise (e.g. `Σ` per-link costs `≤ w.g.toNat`)
  bounds `Σ nᵢ` but can never bound `Σ kᵢ` — collapsing the depth factor to
  something linear is precisely re-proving NeverOutOfFuel's stage-2 descent
  recurrence. So for decompositions WITH call sites, `m + 4 ≤ seedFuel w` is
  the honest interface: callers discharge it by `fuelBound` arithmetic on
  their concrete `kᵢ`, not by execution data. This quantitative reason
  (product vs sum) stands on its own: it does not depend on the historical
  absorption argument (removed 2026-07-20), so the envelope on the general
  bridge remains the honest interface even with a hypothetical proved
  fuel-monotonicity — the offsets are budgets, not observations.

## What was NOT done

The optional refactor (endgame consuming `runΘ_of_X_family` in place of its
inline steps (2)–(4)) is skipped on import-direction friction: the bridge lives
downstream of ObservableTriple (it consumes `Xi_forward`/`Θ_code_forward`), so
the endgame cannot consume it without a module reshuffle; the statement freeze
on `nested_twoCall_completedWith` (T2 depends on it) makes tonight the wrong
night. Duplication is confined to ~20 proof lines and flagged by this note
(ObservableTriple.lean is deliberately untouched).

For the direct bounded-offset bridge, chains whose links are gas-witnessed

`≥ 1` gas, so the chain length is bounded by the world's own gas, which
`seedFuel` dominates linearly. -/

/-- **The derived envelope** — the strongest weakening achieved: for a

condition is DERIVED from execution — the chain's own gas burn bounds its
length by `w.g.toNat` (`ItersG.gas_le` at the entry state, whose gas is `w.g`
by construction of `callerEntry`), and `seedFuel` dominates gas
(`seedFuel_ge_gas`). Only the structural depth cap `w.e ≤ 1024` remains — no
numeric fuel hypothesis. PROVED without placeholders. -/

the caller's `completedWith` observable with NO numeric fuel side condition
anywhere — the closest the nested side can come to flat
`messageCall_runs`-style unconditionality, and (per obstruction item (C)) the
exact boundary of that possibility: one call site in the chain re-introduces
the child's fuel budget, which no linear-in-gas premise can bound. -/
