# The single `messageCall`-boundary bridge, fuel-free

This file holds the **one** `messageCall`-boundary sequencing rule,
`messageCall_runs`, proved **fuel-free** (no numeric `n + … ≤ seedFuel` side
condition) via never-out-of-fuel (`messageCall_never_outOfFuel`) plus the
index-free `Runs` reconciliation invariant `Runs.drive_reconcile`.

`Runs.drive_reconcile` is the engine: since the index-free `Runs` carries no step
count, the bridge cannot phrase a numeric fuel bound. Instead this invariant
says that **any** non-`OutOfFuel` run from any frame on a `Runs` path yields the
same final result — proved by induction on `Runs`, splicing returning external
calls (`call` nodes) into the path via `drive_descend_eq` + `drive_fuel_mono`.

`messageCall_runs` is the intra-frame bridge: a caller that `Runs` from its entry
frame to a halt site produces the expected `messageCall` result. The halt site
delivers in `2` fuel, which `Runs.drive_reconcile` reconciles with the seeded run
(both avoid `OutOfFuel`) — no fuel ordering needed.

Because `Runs` carries external CALLs as `call` nodes (`CallReturns`), this **one**
bridge already covers programs with **any number** of returning external calls,
interleaved with opcode steps in any order: the caller simply builds its
`Runs fr₀ last` with `Runs.call` / `Runs.step` / `Runs.trans` and crosses the
boundary once. The former separate `messageCall_call_runs` (a single `.call` node)
is the one-`.call` special case and is no longer needed; the general
multi-call composition guarantee is `messageCall_runs_calls` below.

/-! ## CREATE descent bricks for the `Runs.create` reconciliation arm

The CALL arm of `Runs.drive_reconcile` splices a returning child via `driveG_needsCall_code`
+ `drive_descend_eq`. CREATE needs the twin bricks. `driveG_needsCreate` is *simpler* than
`driveG_needsCall_code` (`beginCreate` is total — no code/precompile split), but
`drive_descend_create_eq` is *harder*: `Pending.resume (.create pd)` is `resumeAfterCreate …`
which is `Except`-typed, so the descent equation is conditioned on the `.ok parent` witness
(the 63/64 guard passing) — supplied by `CreateReturns`. -/

/-- **A `.needsCreate` descent.** `beginCreate` is total, so `drive` unconditionally
descends into `beginCreate params`, suspending the parent as `.create pending`. -/

      = drive n (.create pending :: ps) (running (beginCreate params)) := by

  dsimp only
  rw [hstep]

/-- **Generic CREATE-boundary descent equation.** The CREATE twin of
`drive_descend_eq`, conditioned on the *successful* resume witness `hok :
resumeAfterCreate res.toCreateResult pd = .ok parent`: a terminating init child run splices
into the parent resumed at `parent`, for some residual fuel `j`. The unbounded
weakening of `drive_descend_create_lt` (`DescentEq.lean`, the strict fuel bound
dropped). -/

/-! ## Lemma 1 — fuel-agnostic agreement of terminating runs -/

stack/state both avoid `OutOfFuel`, they return the same result. The larger fuel
equals the smaller by `drive_fuel_mono` either way. -/

/-- **A terminating run adopts any `.ok` result.** If the run at fuel `a` avoids
`OutOfFuel` and the run at fuel `b` (same stack/state) returns `.ok r`, then the
fuel-`a` run returns the same `.ok r`. Corollary of `drive_eq_of_both_ne_oof`
(an `.ok` run trivially avoids `OutOfFuel`) — the reusable form of the
max-lift/`drive_fuel_mono` reconciliation ritual. -/

/-! ## The index-free `Runs` reconciliation invariant

The `Runs` relation carries no step-index. `Runs.drive_reconcile` is the
replacement for the old exact-fuel `drive_advance`: it states that **any**
non-`OutOfFuel` run from any frame on a `Runs` path yields the same final result.
Proved by induction on the `Runs` derivation, reusing the existing bricks —
`drive_eq_of_both_ne_oof` (the `refl` link), `drive_stepsTo` (the `step` link),
and `drive_descend_eq` + `drive_fuel_mono` (the `call` link, which splices a whole
returning child run into the path). No fuel bookkeeping, no numeric side
condition: the driver self-reconciles across the empty-stack run because every
configuration on the path terminates whenever the endpoints do. -/

/-- **The `Runs` reconciliation invariant.** If `fr` `Runs` to `last`, then any
two terminating (`≠ OutOfFuel`) runs — one from `fr` at fuel `a`, one from `last`
at fuel `b`, both over the empty pending stack — deliver the **same** result.

This is the index-free successor of the old exact-fuel `drive_advance`: it never
mentions a step count, only that the endpoints both avoid `OutOfFuel`. The three
links reuse existing lemmas without reproving them:
* `refl` — `fr = last`, so the two runs reconcile by `drive_eq_of_both_ne_oof`;
* `step` — peel one `drive` step with `drive_stepsTo`, recurse;
* `call` — splice the returning child via `drive_descend_eq` (lifting the
  black-box child run to the path's fuel with `drive_fuel_mono`), then recurse on
  the resumed frame. -/

/-! ## The call-free boundary bridge `messageCall_runs` -/

/-- **A `Runs` block at the `messageCall` boundary, halting.** If a code call's
initial frame `fr₀` (`EntersAsCode p fr₀`) `Runs` to a frame `last` that halts
with `halt`, then `messageCall p = .ok (toCallResult (endFrame last halt))` —
**no numeric fuel side condition**.

The halt site delivers its result in `2` fuel; `Runs.drive_reconcile` reconciles
that with the seeded run from `fr₀` since both avoid `OutOfFuel` (the latter by
`messageCall_never_outOfFuel`) — no step index, no fuel ordering.

This is the boundary; from here up, statements are observable-only. -/

/-! ## Multi-call composition (the general regular-language-shaped guarantee)

`messageCall_runs` already accepts a `Runs fr₀ last` that contains **any number**
of `.call` nodes interleaved with `.step`s in any order — its only premises are
`EntersAsCode p fr₀` and that `last` halts. `messageCall_runs_calls` is the same
statement, re-stated as the explicit "≥N returning external calls compose"
guarantee: it is *definitionally* `messageCall_runs`, named so callers can cite the
multi-call composition contract directly. The reconciliation across every `call`
node lives inside `Runs.drive_reconcile`; there is no per-call halt requirement and
no numeric fuel side condition. -/

/-- **Multi-call composition.** A caller that enters as code (`EntersAsCode p fr₀`)
and whose single `Runs fr₀ last` interleaves **any number of returning external
CALLs** (`.call` / `CallReturns` nodes) with opcode steps, ending at a halting
`last`, delivers the caller's halt result as `messageCall p` — with **no numeric
fuel side condition and no per-call halt requirement**. Intermediary calls (calls
that return into more code rather than halting the program) compose: each is just a
`.call` node spliced into the path by `Runs.drive_reconcile`.

This is `messageCall_runs` under a name that makes the multi-call guarantee
explicit; the caller builds `h` with `Runs.call` / `Runs.step` / `Runs.trans`. -/

/-! ## The general external-CALL rule at the named-`Outcome` level -/

/-- **The general external-CALL rule, observable-level.** A caller that enters as
code and whose single `Runs fr₀ last` carries **any number** of returning external
CALLs (`.call` nodes) to a halting `last`, plus the caller's halt result being a
success leaving `v` at cell `(a, k)`, yields the named `Outcome.completedWith`
predicate on `Outcome.ofCall (messageCall p)`. This is the sound external-call rule
the spec surface exposes — no assumed forwarding, no per-call halt requirement, no
numeric fuel side condition. The caller builds `h` with `Runs.call` /
`Runs.step` / `Runs.trans` (the single-call case is one `.call` node). -/
